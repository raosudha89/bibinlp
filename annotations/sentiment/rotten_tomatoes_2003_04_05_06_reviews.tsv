1	The result is a sumptuous time-teasing story.
2	The romantic fatalism is so lush that you're invited to get lost in it.
3	Quite simply an incomparably sublime work of art, a triumph of lyricism over narrative in the cinema, and the most exquisite homage to the beauty of women it has ever been my privilege to witness on the screen.
4	Wong offers an artful meditation on the nature of love, making effective use of color schemes (yellows, greens and reds), placid shotmaking and diverse music to deliver a sultry portrait of postwar Hong Kong.
5	Wwithout a doubt, it's seductively perplexing and devilishly good-looking -- and if you like it, you'll probably find that one viewing isn't enough.
6	For all its balance and grandeur, 2046 is the most nervous of Wong's films.
7	2046 thus comes to encapsulate everything to which Wong (and, in turn, his audience) keeps returning.
8	In the mood for sublimity
9	Seductive and luscious, a cinematic smorgasbord of sensuous delight.
10	Here, the mystery of the deepest recesses of human emotion are plundered for cinematic play.
11	A bleak, rather obvious melodrama disguised by a tricksy, time-splicing structure.
12	This is cinematic storytelling of a very high order, and the clear work of a moviemaker who has almost instantly established himself as a force to be reckoned with.
13	Though not depressing, because nothing this good is, the film is haunting -- a walk on the razor's edge between life and death.
14	If not for its show-offy back-and- forthing of time, the movie would be a banal, pointlessly depressing exercise.
15	Tough, smart, relentless, provocative and, above all, serious.
16	Inarritu and Arriaga's first English-language film doesn't approach the brilliance of Amores Perros, but it succeeds on a more modest scale.
17	Thought-provoking film not for tweens/young teens.
18	A highly emotional, thought provoking drama that easily lives up to the hype, 21 Grams is a film that has all of its bases covered: script, acting and direction.
19	Une oeuvre d'une rare intensité dramatique qui n'a aucunement besoin de suivre un cheminement narratif classique pour susciter une vive réaction chez le spectateur
20	The structure simply doesn't let any of the characters build an arc of growth or despair.
21	Quite what age group this soft-centered entertainment is aimed at is hard to divine.
22	Stupid, coarse and abysmally unfunny.
23	Ends up making you pine for Lucy's gift of forgetting.
24	This movie paints itself into a corner from which it cannot emerge without becoming an utter disaster as far as I'm concerned.
25	Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore shine in this sweet, flirty comedy about a man who falls for a woman with short-term memory loss.
26	A chick flick for guys, with a pH balance in perfect equilibrium between the crass and the sweet.
27	...has an unexpected emotional undertow and enough hard-won laughs to make it succeed.
28	A surprisingly good film with a sweet story...
29	Within the witlessness and crudeness is a touching (or mawkish, depending on your perspective) romantic comedy trying to get out.
30	The moments that Sandler and Barrymore can steal together are golden.
31	Though the set-up in this light romantic comedy is a bit strained, once you get into the main interaction with the two stars you get both the laughs and the emotion that you hope for in a film like this.
32	Gossamer thin, but lots of fun nevertheless.
33	The less you know about this movie before seeing it -- and you really should see it -- the better.
34	Cronenberg's direction, mirroring the split in Tom, is alternately measured and frighteningly explosive, and, as always, he gives the movie a nasty underlay of sexual perversity.
35	This peculiarly predictable picture has been calculated, or miscalculated, to set up certain expectations, fulfill them, and then do the same thing again, thereby giving us a chance to see what's coming and, at least in theory, be shocked.
36	A remarkably convincing examination of heroism, hero worship, and the seductive allure of villainy.
37	The film, based on a graphic novel, has a crackling sense of visual tension.
38	A model of clean, lean storytelling.
39	Hopefully [it will] encourage a sobering sense of responsibility and a more truthful perspective on identities (individual and national).
40	A fascinating exercise in cinematic restraint resulting in a captivating, not to be missed film.
41	With A History Of Violence, Cronenberg uses the pulp gangster genre - as opposed to, say, sci-fi horror -- to draw us into a dialogue on our relationship as voyeurs to violence, both real and cinematic.
42	Without conceding any of his iconoclastic vision, Cronenberg has turned a genre film with classic Western overtones into a gripping psychological drama that examines the duality of man and his infatuation with the art of violence.
43	While it weakens in its final stretch...A History of Violence succeeds enormously thanks to the strength of its direction and performances.
44	A truly entertaining and engrossing study of violence, family, and our pasts eventually coming back to haunt us...
45	Here's the final mystery about Accepted: Why title a movie that so readily invites the headline Rejected as a critical riposte?
46	Even though it outright plagiarizes many plot points and gags of that generational classic, Accepted can't make the leap from contrived to genuine comedy.
47	If you can lighten up for an hour and a half, the film delivers one good laugh after another.
48	Too bad what begins as a cheerfully irreverent comedy in the tradition of Animal House gets all pious when it slams fraternity culture at neighboring Harmon College.
49	It has a few funny bits here and there, but they're deeply mired in the seen-it-all-beforeness of the film.
50	Sporadically entertaining but relentlessly lightweight...
51	Though keeping worthwhile targets - like professors who want to see their most creative students fail - director Steve Pink lets his punk inspiration slide into standard school rivalries and unrelated slapstick.
52	The movie works on the pure energy of its straight-faced silliness.
53	[Accepted] would be funnier with an R rating on principle
54	Average comedy that's low on jokes and doesn't quite live up to its premise, though it remains watchable thanks to a charming performance by Justin Long.
55	By summoning his inner classicist, [director] Stone has made an excruciating disaster for the ages.
56	Though the battles have the blood-and-sinew bravado you expect from Oliver Stone, this three-hour buttnumbathon is hamstrung by a hectoring grandiosity, not new to Stone, and a nod toward caution, which is.
57	At a reported cost of $155 million, Alexander qualifies as a super-spectacle in every respect but one -- namely in its neurotic, confused and sexually ambidextrous hero.
58	Sluggish, unsmiling, and almost as limp as the feather fans with which our heroes are gently aerated on their trip to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
59	It's just a wild, glorious, wacky mess that I found really entertaining.
60	This new set presents the film in great quality and comes with some fantastic special features, but it's doubtful that this latest version of "Alexander" is going to change anyone's mind as to the quality of the film itself.
61	For the lucky few that see this without ever having viewed the first cut, they may wonder what all the criticism was about in the first place.
62	General mistakes all across the board contribute and reinforce each other to bring it down
63	This is ultimately "Alexander" as written by Danielle Steele...
64	Stone doesn't present characters that the audience can believe in, even for one moment, as representative of their historic roles.
65	Costa-Gavras deserves credit for staying the course; in a time when most European film directors are wringing their hands, he's still pointing fingers.
66	Tukur's performance is the centerpiece of the movie; it's a wonderful mixture of outrage and swiftly disappearing naivete.
67	In a remarkably subtle turn, the German Tukur is convincing as [Gerstein].
68	What should have been agonizing in its impact comes off as wooden, perhaps because Costa-Gavras works in schematic fashion, spoon-feeding us issues while skimming the historical surface.
69	Amen., a docudrama rather than a documentary, is clearly guided by Shoah's example, asking us to reflect on the Holocaust and what made it possible rather than simply recoil from it.
70	a sputtering, wet firecracker
71	Though Costa-Gavras brings nothing new to the table about the Holocaust, he puts another nail down in the argument that the world could have acted but didn't because of indifference.
72	Though such elements might chip away somewhat at Amen's seriousness of intent, they do add fire to the stimulating drama.
73	It's so inert, so slow-moving that it seems at least twice as long as it really is, and it manages to waste a potentially fascinating premise.
74	Costa-Gavras often shortchanges the story's inherent drama for talky and strident speechifying.
75	Extremely heavy-handed, almost comically repetitious, and way too long.
76	Alejandro González Iñárritu's latest sprawling, dispersed art-film blockbuster prompts a question: Does he just not know how to tell a story?
77	If misery is your pornography, Babel is your holy grail.
78	It's a great film made with style and heart and hope, a cautionary parable and an almost certain Oscar contender.
79	The experience of watching Babel is undeniably riveting: Even if the film doesn't really lead anywhere, you still can't take your eyes off it.
80	Babel is a beautifully depressing film about responsibility, redemption, and ultimately that there are consequences to people's actions, regardless of who they are and where they live.
81	The gimmick-machinery whirrs, but the human beings in it can't breath
82	Director Alejandro González Iñárritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga have fashioned their ideas with conviction and obvious care.
83	An ensemble cast, low-key drama, and tolerable political commentary make "Babel" a gripping success.
84	Babel...belongs to an unfortunately proliferating genre that might be called the higher kitsch.
85	...language acts more as a means to distance and isolate us than aid in our understanding of one another.
86	Nolan takes an admirable stab at developing a character-driven drama, only to give in to generic action-movie conventions with a blinding, deafening, explosion-laden finale that could have capped off any number of interchangeable Jerry Bruckheimer flicks.
87	It's not just the birth of Batman we're seeing in this triumphant interpretation, it's also the dawning of Gotham City's age of greed.
88	Here's how any great franchise should start: with care, precision and delicately wrought atmosphere.
89	A nonstarter.
90	A rousing, reverent, often brilliant re-creation of a seminal comics character.
91	... Nolan gets the character right: Bruce Wayne is the secret identity and Batman is the real persona.
92	It's a refreshing approach to the genre, even when revisiting years later, in an era inundated with superhero movies where each tries to better the last's visual effects budget.
93	Compared to the flashier Superman, the dark knight was always more human and prone to brooding, but this film is way out of whack.
94	Every so often, it's time to re-boot Batman.
95	It may be too scary intense for younger children, but for everyone else Batman Begins is just about the perfect summer movie.
96	I was really glad when it was over.
97	One of the cuddliest, cutest movies you'll ever see about mobsters and murderers.
98	You know a sequel isn't working when, ten minutes into the movie, a voice inside your head starts screaming, 'Please make it stop!'
99	Be Cool lacks both a focus and an edge, making it an amorphous mess.
100	The movie feels more like a cavalcade of personalities than anything resembling a story.
101	It's kind of -- hmmmm, less than good, a little better than not bad, almost all right, mediocre without being grating, sort of in the C-minus-to-C-minus-minus range.
102	Watered-down sequel isn't meant for kids.
103	Self-mocking jokes prevail in F. Gary Gray's feisty cinematic version of Elmore Leonard's irreverent Los Angeles based novel.
104	click to read review [Greek]
105	The characters are still engaging, but the story is a mess this time around.
106	The reunion has some lively moments, but a great deal of slow walking and fatuous talking about love, married life and sex.
107	Shooting in long takes, Linklater and his actors (who get co-screenwriting credit) allow the conversation to curlicue effortlessly from literate banter to matters of the heart, and sometimes to places in between.
108	At the risk of overhyping 80 minutes of intimate real-time, this is the soul of generosity, a beautifully vibrant and big-spirited film.
109	Before Sunrise and Before Sunset are a rare case of two movies that rightfully demand yet another sequel.
110	A richer experience than the original.
111	...a superior sequel that accomplishes everything that one might've hoped...
112	A stone-cold masterpiece.
113	Charming, talky romance for older teens and adults.
114	As a romance streaked with regrets, obligations and fears, "Sunset" builds to a wistful, perfect conclusion - a fadeout infused with the idea that a memory's never finished as long as you're alive and one of the loveliest last-line exchanges of all time.
115	the film takes a miraculous healing turn at the end, and the characters rise above their ruefulness, and use it as a springboard into hope
116	Well acted, very well written, well told, and bears yet another ending that will keep audiences wondering.
117	Overall, the film feels like it issues from a place Burton doesn't inhabit.
118	A compelling look at the relationships between fathers and sons, and the child coming to terms with the parent's mortality.
119	A long-winded indulgence in tear-and-a-smile whimsy.
120	A disappointingly dull thud of a fantasy.
121	the father-and-son story to beat all father-and-son stories
122	Delightful, sad father-son story for teens and up.
123	Reliant more on powerful familial emotions than wacky splendor, "Big Fish" treads as close to our real world as Tim Burton ever could - a melancholy dissection of paternal distance and never truly knowing how many lives those we love can truly affect.
124	Burton invokes the imagination from his crowd and succeeds in making us gasp in wonder.
125	Never has going fishing or getting caught been such a treat.
126	Unusually austere and ambiguous.
127	By trying to turn Birth into a thriller, the filmmakers undermine its intriguing issues.
128	A dismayingly skillful exercise in high-style creepiness.
129	I didn't find it spellbinding at all.
130	The picture, as a whole, never gets beyond its surface.
131	Too highbrow for the multiplex and too literal for the hipsters, it's unsatisfying both as gothic camp and serious cinema.
132	Ten years after premiering at the Venice Film Festival in 2004, Jonathan Glazer's Birth remains as powerfully mysterious as ever.
133	What begins as a promising and provocative melodrama gradually turns into na conventional and frustrating movie, aimless and pretentious.
134	What were they thinking?
135	Kidman has another turkey for her resume.
136	Manhattan-based supernatural thriller done in the tone of "Rosemary's Baby" starts out strong but loses all steam in its third act.
137	all the best and all the worst things associated with the phrase "art film"
138	It's depressing to see a deluxe cast wasted on such by-the-numbers material.
139	Bonneville is scarcely original and in no way earthshaking, but its notable cast is a pleasure to behold.
140	When you've got three of the nation's best actresses in leading roles, it doesn't matter if your script is only adequate and the audience really has to squint here and there to believe what's happening on the screen.
141	There are zero surprises in the road comedy Bonneville, sadly including the fact that three middle-age actresses with three Oscars and nine nominations among them couldn't find anything more challenging to do.
142	There's no avoiding the fact that Christopher Rowley's feature debut is as uninspired and predictable as your average Lifetime movie.
143	The story just doesn't do enough to pull the heartstrings.
144	Unfortunately, it's as flimsy as tissue, and the actresses, all 50+, really do more with the material...than it deserves.
145	Thank heavens for the practical presence and humour of Bates, and the quiet conservatism of Allen's performance as a pious woman scared of too much freedom.
146	A film full of emotional false notes, bad dialogue and cardboard characters...
147	For a film about discovering your own journey, it sure sticks to the main roads.
148	While the premise of this roadtrip come buddy movie may be based on loss, the journey we take is a vibrant one
149	Fright fans expecting anything more than the occasional jolt will be sorely disappointed.
150	A vaporous and vacuous horror film.
151	None of this makes any sense whatsoever.
152	A welcome throwback to the glory days of scary movies.
153	This is strictly substandard stuff, with imitative creepy noises, vertiginous camera angles, and long pauses during which Tim considers whether to open doors.
154	It suffers from a lack of genuine chills or suspense.
155	A bloated 86 minutes of overzealous spookiness.
156	A thinly plotted clothesline of shock effects.
157	full review in Greek
158	This film does cause shivers, creeps, scares, and jumps.
159	Few films benefited that much from being so short.
160	For a good, healthy PG-13 scare, Boogeyman is fun for the whole family -- just don't bring kids who are too young.
161	Modest but guileless.
162	Brother Bear is a very mild animated entry from Disney with a distinctly recycled feel.
163	Another watchable, old-fashioned, uninspired Disney animation.
164	A lame duck of a movie.
165	It feels like a project that got quietly pushed through the pipeline while the studio gears up for bigger and better things.
166	...often just as dull as it is engaging...
167	Lackluster story only for kindergarteners.
168	If "the CEO wants to sell teddy bears" isn't going to inspire writers to do their best work, what on Earth possibly could?
169	Compared to the Disney classics, this is a lazy and forgettable misfire.
170	A sweet family film about love and tolerance.
171	It also seems to want to have a message, but it's a little tougher to spot than the usual "Be true to yourself" or "Face up to your destiny."
172	A soap-opera patchwork of worn backstage cliches.
173	Fame may seem silly in retrospect, but Camp, with its dippy dialogue and characters revealing even less complexity than the ones from 42nd Street, arrives silly.
174	You'll have trouble keeping your toes from tapping.
175	The kids have energy to burn, and you can't help but marvel at the polish they bring to a variety of numbers from a variety of musicals.
176	Its earnest acting and brimming-over love for musicals are infectious, and most of its shopworn narrative devices play as tribute rather than trite.
177	Todd Graff, better known as writer, makes a decent (but no more)directing debut with this mildly amusing but unoriginal indie about a bunch of gays and heteros putting on a show.
178	Funny movie about theater camp for teens.
179	One doesn't have to be a theater queen to appreciate Camp's humor, but it wouldn't hurt.
180	So chock-full of insider theater references that the film reads like a trivia contest held in the Acapulco Room on a cruise sponsored by Broadway.com
181	Lying somewhere between Fame and Meatballs, Camp unfortunately possesses neither the energy of the former nor the hilarity of the latter.
182	The highlights of the film are when the ostensible plotlines are dropped, and the truly talented kids get a chance to perform.
183	Capote is a cool and polished hall of mirrors reflecting the ways in which Truman Capote came to write (and be written by) In Cold Blood.
184	Hoffman goes beyond impersonation to something close to possession.
185	Skillfully and economically put together.
186	The almost perfectly realized Capote -- stumbling only in the lack of shading it gives Keener's and Greenwood's characters -- offers a sobering glimpse at what the author had to give up of his soul to achieve his success.
187	A meditation on the artist's obligations to the art and to society and lines that blur when you cross them.
188	It's a fully realized look at a time and place as well as a riveting study of career obsessions warring with a sense of justice.
189	Its power comes from the slow, steady build to the execution of Perry Smith, the man half-responsible for the murders of a farming family of four, and what that death does to Capote.
190	Miller and Futterman underscore the idea that what Capote's achievement does to the story of Hickock and Smith and the Clutter killings is to remove it from the actual world and place it in a literary one.
191	In a career that has seen actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman play a vast array of characters (and very well at that), Hoffman has found the role of a lifetime which he delivers with uncanny precision.
192	Aims for starkness but ends up as tastefulness
193	The Passion of Truman Capote
194	Hoffman tries, but mainly just gets the surface of Capote.
195	Rips off Doc Hollywood, almost note for note.
196	Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter, small-town life may well be lost on this movie's young audience -- Cars finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove.
197	Cars made me want to hop in my jalopy and to head out to Route 66, bypassing the boring interstate highways that made the Mother Road redundant.
198	'Cars' has energy and heart-two things that 'Robots' lacked.
199	Cars is a nice homily to small town life and remembering the past - which definitely has its charms - and call for remembering our roots, but it's been done better elsewhere.
200	Pixar's grown so metallic that having automobiles for animated characters becomes disturbingly apt
201	Although the plot coasts along a predictable path, the verbal jokes and sight gags rev things up along the way, making the film enjoyable almost from start to finish.
202	Adam Sandler still coasts on American pop culture's peculiar indulgence of boys who won't grow up
203	It's a farce about loss, and it doesn't flinch.
204	A domestic tragedy masquerading as a frothy frolic.
205	The jokes don't come frequently enough in Click, and aren't all that funny.
206	[Click] is an abomination.
207	Click brings up some very real problems about adult life but it answers them with Hollywood platitudes ... granted, it's about having fun not trying to find solutions to the problems of modern existence, but it still seems a bit disingenuous.
208	A fascinating film with an unresolved comedy/tragedy axis
209	"Click" is a one-trick-pony of a comedy.
210	As a broad family comedy this is perfectly acceptable, but from a sci-fi point of view it's a very pale imitation of the time travel classics it seeks to ape.
211	For all its competing aspirations, the movie just never clicks.
212	I loved it.
213	Throughout the gruesome cat-and-mouse game being played by Vincent and Max in Collateral, there's something psychologically, dramatically and even sociologically interesting going on.
214	This is a tense, first-rate thriller.
215	Most of the time we are with Cruise and Foxx, and their interplay is never less than galvanizing.
216	After that promising start, Collateral ratchets down, gradually, to being only average.
217	If Collateral is all formula, it's polished to a fine sheen.
218	A visually striking film from the unhinged, endlessly creative mind of Michael Mann.
219	The year's best action thriller with excellent performances from its two leads and Mann's brilliant direction making something as pedestrian as a taxi ride a pulse-pounding thrill ride.
220	Powerful but violent thriller -- not for kids.
221	Mann takes a predictably clichéd, far-fetched crime yarn and transforms it into a fascinating thriller.
222	If anyone is ever to mount an argument for the superiority of video over film, this movie would of necessity be very near to the center of that argument.
223	A very superior thriller with excellent direction and utterly top-notch performances...
224	Overplotted, overcontrived, overshot and overedited.
225	This is a one sweet sexy sting of a movie.
226	Identity is suicidally insecure.
227	What it shares with most of its predecessors is a sterling cast, in this instance almost entirely male, and the willingness of several talented performers to play against type, with entertainingly comic effect.
228	... Confidence does suffer a bit from some plot devices that haven't been original since The Sting, but it's a top-notch character study and a fun exercise in style.
229	A lazy, paint-by-numbers thriller...
230	I was entertained, but hardly stunned.
231	Jammed with double and triple-crosses that make Doug Jung's confusing screenplay secondary to the film's overall look.
232	While it sometimes fails to live up to its title, Confidence ultimately, wins us over-in short, it dazzlingly does what all good cons are supposed to do.
233	Misses the first rule of whodunnit filmmaking and never recovers; if you fool me once, you have to at least give me a reason to care that I've been fooled.
234	Blazes few new trails and bogs down in a confusing narrative muddle.
235	I deeply loathe the Heaven-and-Hell genre to which this cinematic comic-book spectacular belongs.
236	Halfway through Constantine, a fully clad Keanu Reeves steps into a shallow pail of water, sits on a chair next to it and holds a cat in his lap.
237	Peaks early, then descends into portentous nonsense.
238	Entirely beyond redemption.
239	Reeves, meanwhile, has confidently entered his self-parodic period.
240	Days are seared by burning sunlight, nights swallow the world and bring out the demons, and Hell is an Earth burning in the nuclear fires of Armageddon.
241	Visuals and attitude -- not for kids.
242	An enjoyable revelation.
243	A very satisfying film.
244	The prime conceit of the movie is its gallows humor that seeps out like clotting blood from a decomposing corpse.
245	Rachel Weisz gives it her best shot, but she can't save the messy script from its own feelings self-importance.
246	It's a promising concept, but instead of expending effort on, say, a coherent script, the filmmakers lazily rely on cheap editing tricks and gleefully relentless sadism.
247	Leave it alone, or leave your brain and pocket change at the gate, strap yourself in and just enjoy the ride.
248	Viewers baffled by stuff happening for no particular reason should probably stay well away.
249	For those who enjoy this brand of wholly mindless entertainment, Crank delivers.
250	Jason Stratham rampages through Los Angeles in this retread of Speed, but for a movie premised on unrelenting action, Crank proves fatally turgid.
251	The movie is cranked up somewhere between stylish and proudly stupid.
252	It's trashy, gory, gratuitous, ridiculous, completely far-fetched, and I had a smile on my face the entire time.
253	Gets by on a unique kind of absurd, deadpan humor in which the most implausible stuff cheerfully happens anyway.
254	Sure, Crank is totally ridiculous, unbelievable, exhausting, and pretty much just plain stupid, but that's what makes it fun.
255	Ranks among the most mindless action films ever made, but scores as a helluva video game.
256	The super-concentrated silt at the bottom of a chemistry experiment that has no possible purpose to it but to deliver whatever limited jolt of which it's capable.
257	Its freneticism ... futilely tries to cover up the ludicrousness of every decision made by its dim characters.
258	Torn between moody grandiosity and cartoonish mayhem, Daredevil tries to have it both ways, and succeeds at neither.
259	[A] dull actioner.
260	Writer-director Mark Steven Johnson's movie is too heavily reliant on tried and tested ingredients, such as Batman-type design and Matrix-style fighting.
261	Daredevil, as brought to the screen by writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, brings real violence and death into the comic book mix, and the result is a fascinating blend of the fantastic and the tragic.
262	Daredevil is a perfectly serviceable B-movie, something to tide over genre fans waiting for X-Men 2.
263	For all its clichés, it has a cracking third act, helped by doses of 15-rated violence.
264	The results ... are staid, with re-creations of Paris in the Jazz Age and Hollywood in its Golden Age that are like waxworks in motion.
265	A wildly uneven musical biography of Cole Porter.
266	Not inept enough to make the composer spin in his grave ... but not insightful or clever enough to please the old boy, either.
267	Winkler indulges a large amount of screentime detailing these sexual leanings and complications, which disrupts the picture's balance between wannabe musical and straight up bio-pic.
268	The music is de-lovely, but not much else is.
269	More imagination than inquiry, this cautiously reverential tale reaches for aesthetic pleasure and emotion over insight.
270	If you ignore the plot and just approach the flick as nothing more than a 21st century update of a Busby Berkeley-style musical, you will not be disappointed.
271	Performances crackling with an enthusiasm that indicates how much Porter's work continues to be loved and respected.
272	Take away a couple of neatly staged action sequences and you're left with a callously measured slab of US jingoism that deals with the most horrific human tragedies in the most lunk-headed and insulting way possible.
273	I felt cheated.
274	Rarely have [producer] Bruckheimer and [director] Scott been so upfront about insulting people's intelligence.
275	Nobody looks cooler walking in slow motion through a crime scene while wearing sunglasses than Denzel Washington -- but even the great Denzel can't save Déjà Vu.
276	The fleetingly satisfying Déjà Vu is ultimately a self-fulfilling prophecy.
277	Pretty dazzling, as action adventures go, even when it's wildly, almost defiantly, implausible.
278	An intriguing proposal squandered on a well-oiled hack mechanism
279	The time machine element of the movie gets hokey, but the visuals are intriguing and director Tony Scott wrenches suspense and tension from every scene.

281	Like its protagonist, you may find yourself wanting to see it more than once to appreciate how everything fits together - which earns Deja Vu the status of a classic, at least for the future.
282	King is dreamily free-associating, which doesn't mean he's plumbing his unconscious in search of new nightmare archetypes; it means he's recycling bits of old horror and sci-fi flicks and even setups from his own novels.
283	Stupid, sophomoric and moronically silly, it leaves you with the feeling that you might welcome shock treatment just to get your brain back.
284	... not since Death to Smoochy have so many talented people made such a mess of things.
285	If hopeless literalist Kasdan could have decided on a tone ... this could have been a gynophobe's Independence Day.
286	A bumpy thrill ride.
287	Easily one of the most absurdly over-plotted and incoherently condensed horror movies of recent times.
288	As soon as Morgan Freeman's alien hunter/military commander turns up, a riveting movie starts morphing into a predictable villain-on-the-warpath action flick.
289	This Stephen King is way too scary for kids.
290	There's a great cast, and a great director, but ultimately the finishing product fails to live up to any potential.
291	Call me crude -- I have to love a scene of suspense built around fallen toothpicks and a toilet monster.
292	Those looking for a stomach-turning alien film may be pleased, but those looking for a smarter psychological thriller will be sorely disappointed.
293	I challenge you to name a movie with a more convoluted or preposterous storyline.
294	Definitely lives down to its name -- you can see the lips moving on this wooden thing.
295	[T]he best ventriloquist -stalker -family-drama -romantic -comedy I've seen in, well maybe forever.
296	Pritikin's shrewd comedy-drama catches a fine flock of family emotions on the wing, and not the over-exposed ones.
297	What could have been a biting dark comedy is, instead, uninspired and generic.
298	Brody is a real talent, and Illeana Douglas is a riot as his older sister.
299	A mildly engaging addition to that curious sub-genre of American independent filmmaking, the whimsical comedy of Long Island alienation.
300	Pritikin may be asking his audience to pay attention and embrace small successes, but with Dummy, he has pulled off a great one.
301	Pritikin's movie succeeds...thanks to its spirited, oddball humor and winning performances
302	Like its mini-mouthpiece, as pleasantly entertaining as Dummy often is, this ultimately hollow film sounds a few too many wooden notes and creaky jokes.
303	Set at an odd pitch, one best described as shrill.
304	The characters are all strangely endearing, and the real pleasure of the movie is just watching them interact.
305	Surprisingly endearing in moments thanks to finely tuned comic performances, especially from Brody.
306	There isn't a whisper of spontaneity.
307	The movie's dominant visual tone is bronzed grunge, and its emotional tone is depressive.
308	This doesn't exactly set the world on fire, but I was charmed by its old-fashioned storytelling, which is refreshingly free of archness, self-consciousness, or Kill Bill-style wisecracks.
309	Everything comes back to Garner, though -- and even when the movie takes itself too seriously, thankfully she never does.
310	Elektra shoves Frank Miller's eponymous cold-blooded assassin into a PG-13-friendly adventure.
311	A none too Marvel-lous spin-off from Daredevil.
312	Garner, who showed a promising comic touch last year in 13 Going On 30, does her movie career no favors here.
313	If the film isn't as bad as some others in the comics-to-cinema genre (Halle Berry's Catwoman has rather lowered the bar), that's not to say it's good.
314	Worth a look.
315	Daredevil's lady friend Elektra gets a solo outing in this insipid action adventure.
316	Even the action scenes flirt with tedium.
317	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind goes by like a fevered dream of love, but one you remember vividly, with profound pleasure.
318	The latest and loveliest alternative universe created by Charlie Kaufman, America's most -- we should probably say only -- intellectually provocative screenwriter.
319	A surprisingly bittersweet love story at heart, Eternal Sunshine values the sum of experience, which in this case means a thorns-and-all openness to romantic possibilities.
320	Works marvel after marvel in expressing the bewildering beauty and existential horror of being trapped inside one's own addled mind, and in allegorising the self-preserving amnesia of a broken but hopeful heart.
321	The wacky sight gags and psycho-drama slapstick is tinged with melancholy and regret ...
322	One of the most insightfully sad explorations of the human drive for love since Annie Hall concluded that we need the eggs.
323	Pretty fancy stuff, for a sci-fi romantic comedy.
324	This outing from Kaufman's oddball imagination is wonderfully intriguing, often touching and typically convoluted.
325	Marvel Comics continues to empty out its stable of superheroes with this entertaining tale.
326	Fantastic it most certainly ain't.
327	A garish mediocrity.
328	Before the inevitable and surprisingly anticlimactic battle with Doom, we are treated to two extreme-sports demonstrations, several training montages, [and] an ill-advised love triangle.
329	It exists largely to entertain and delight, which used to be precisely what summer blockbusters were engineered to do.
330	Lee and Kirby built Marvel Comics on the foundation of the FF and it's no stretch to say this franchise could still be going strong a decade later with a better opening act.
331	Fantastic Four is actually very true to its source material - often literally so - but generally misses the spirit entirely.
332	Some comics just shouldn't be turned in to movies...
333	Director Tim Story ("Barbershop") sets an uneven tempo for the embarrassingly clunky script by Michael France ("Hulk") and Mark Frost ("Storyville").
334	The film is made in the internet equivalent of capital letters and its simplistic morality stands out on the big screen more so than on the small page.
335	Harrison Ford is outshone by his costars in this crisp, conventional thriller.
336	Its formulaic moves seem particuarly tired.
337	The movie gets a lift from Mary Lynn Rajskub in a glamorized version of her nerd's wet dream Chloe on 24, which is also better this year with the Chloe quotient pumped up.
338	You've seen this movie a dozen times.
339	This is one of the dopiest plans in the history of evil genius plans.
340	Firewall is barely worth seeing, despite its above-average cast.
341	There's only so much Ford's ever-game efforts can do to dress up dreck.
342	Such a vapid vehicle for every single cast member that it's difficult to actually enjoy.
343	The movie is so disposable that you won't remember you've seen it.
344	Another edge-of-your-seat, roller coaster ride from a matinee idol everybody loves to root for.
345	A solid ensemble almost saves Firewall, but, in the end, it goes up in campy flames.
346	Director Richard Loncraine shows no affinity for the nuts and bolts of constructing thrillers, playing out the script's empty threats and chases at a lethargic pace.
347	The premise provides a fine showcase for the two appealing actresses, who appropriate each other's vocal and physical mannerisms with dead-on accuracy.
348	Nothing's really wrong here, but nor are there surprises.
349	A likable but flimsy retread that's barely worth the effort.
350	The material here may not be the freshest, but screenwriters Heather Hach and the redoubtable Leslie Dixon have buffed the dialogue until it sparkles like the finest cubic zirconium, and the cast is game from top to bottom.
351	It's really a family film, deftly updated for the 2003 market, but still sweetly funny at its heart.
352	What should have been a bland Disney remake has somehow ended up as the most satisfying family comedy for a long time.
353	Mother-daughter switch is fun comedic chaos.
354	A sitcom formula film that tries too hard.
355	A fun, very well-acted and laugh out loud funny remake.
356	The two featured females offset these distractions by having so much apparent fun that it becomes contagious.
357	A hilarious, heartwarming remake.
358	Feels too piecemeal and ultimately inconsequential to grab the public where it counts.
359	This is a movie where 'sensitivity' and 'sincerity' are signposted by songs by Paul Simon and Nick Drake, which I guess says it all.
360	Mr. Braff, Ms. Portman, Mr. Sarsgaard and Mr. Holm never strike a false note as a remarkably coherent acting ensemble, and it is good to see Ron Leibman again in the small role of Doctor Cohen.
361	Cleverly written, sensitively directed and very well-acted.
362	His movie is sweet-natured and skillful, but its biggest problem is perhaps one Braff wasn't prepared to deal with: his own performance -- or, more accurately, the decision to place a deliberately flat performance at the film's heart.
363	Garden State may not define an entire generation, but it has a sharp eye for the passive aimlessness that can take hold when young adults realize there's no handbook on how to find purpose and meaning in life.
364	Braff captures the specific, self-involved ennui of the aimless 20-something, and he doesn't do it from a point of smug detachment.
365	Although flawed, Garden State is a good-natured film whose very likeability leaves you willing to overlook its shortcomings.
366	Smart drama for mature older teens and up.
367	It's no longer a generational alarm clock, but for those who've seen loved ones stumble through complacent fogs of Paxil, Zoloft and the like, "Garden State" still warns that "stability" doesn't mean a numbness to anything not emotionally even-keeled.
368	There is not a shot in this movie that doesn't shine...
369	Actor Zach Braff (NBC's "Scrubs") makes an impressive if unsatisfying writing and directing debut with a plaintive post-modern drama that relies on unspoken dry wit to entertain its audience (think a cross between "Harold and Maude" and "The Graduate").
370	Like many similar documentaries, this 2002 feature doesn't present easy answers, but by letting the two girls register as individuals, it forces the viewer to care about them when few around them can be bothered.
371	The trajectories of Shanae's and Megan's lives speak volumes for themselves.
372	It isn't just difficult to do justice to Shanae and Megan in an average of 44 minutes apiece; as it turns out, it's impossible.
373	While it is one part a coming-of-age story and one part a story of girls and mothers, Girlhood is just as much about the attainment of wisdom.
374	It shows a fascination with the criminal justice system, and amazing access to the people caught in its wheels.
375	Chilling, depressing, yet guardedly optimistic.
376	Girlhood thoughtfully questions not just the system itself, but our unfair assumptions about the young people caught within it.
377	To the film's great credit, [director] Garbus evens out her often heavy-hand and we're given the emotional core of two young female criminals in ways often eluded in the movies.
378	..disturbing, yet life affirming portrait ... girlhood is an early stage of life, but the consequences of mistakes upon womanhood and, more significantly, motherhood will ...
379	Deeply affecting in the moment, but I'm not sure that Garbus draws much in the way of larger conclusions.
380	Fascinating and, at times, surprisingly moving.
381	Personally, I'd rather have this movie obliterated from my memory.
382	Packaged in an increasingly lurid, credibility-free storyline, delivered with unstinting insensitivity by a first-time director determined to show off his ad-man's box of visual tics.
383	It's well worth seeing, because it is well made -- apart from a few gaps in logic -- and well acted.
384	... a film that gives you something to think about, raising questions that linger long after the theater lights have brightened.
385	Hard Candy is an exploitation film, with very little happening but a guy getting tortured for about 75 minutes of screen time.
386	... icky, incoherent thriller ...
387	An exploitation of a set of themes rather than a thoughtful consideration of them, and celebrates their austere nature in a stampede of scenes that cause only surface discomfort.
388	One of the more original and grueling films to come out in years and I loved it...
389	Slick slime wrapped as a high-toned, girl-power shocker
390	Wilson and Page are compelling and Slade demonstrates a slick stylistic flair, but the over over-the-top shock pandering renders the dark lesson convoluted and hard to swallow.
391	Slade and his actors keep the tension high, and the questions don't come to mind until after the credits roll.
392	I didn't expect much from Hitch and, not surprisingly, I didn't get much -- but I was entranced by the film nonetheless, from a historical perspective.
393	Looks like another love TKO.
394	Smith, of course, is so cool he can afford to pretend to be uncool; but what really works for him here is the interplay with James, whose inner-wild-man dance moves alone are worth the price of admission.
395	Under- whelming, and predictable cookie cutter romantic comedy fluff...
396	Will Smith charms again; best for teens and up.
397	In a movie where the film's trailer has spoiled all its best scenes, and the onscreen chemistry between our primary lovebirds is a failed experiment, it's refreshing that "Hitch" still provides that rare buoyant romantic lift that the genre promises.
398	full review in Greek
399	Fans of movies like The Wedding Planner and You've Got Mail looking for a charming date movie with lots of laughs will fall in love with Hitch.
400	Brims with storytelling flourishes and gently deployed life lessons that even accompanying adults may dig.
401	[T]here's too much going on, and none of it is executed well enough to recommend.
402	It's smart, strange, unpredictable, and defies the formulas that typically define this sort of motion picture.
403	A wonderfully dark fairy tale.
404	One can't help but feel thankful that the movie doesn't always go the expected route, that the characters have a little more depth to them than average, and that the complexity, which is the movie's basic weakness, is also its fundamental virtue.
405	Crazy as it is, Holes could be the Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory of 2003.
406	Young viewers and old alike will be given powerful metaphors of servanthood and selflessness, humility and honor, courage and Christ-like kindness.
407	O roteiro leve e bem construído, aliado às performances de um elenco carismático, deu origem ao tipo de filme que certamente divertirá toda a família.
408	Unlike so many kids movies, Holes hasn't been dumbed down, loaded with bathroom humor
409	Funny, inspiring and just a little bit naughty, Holes is excellent family entertainment.
410	For all its faults, Holes has an overriding good humor and sense of fun that saves it from the usual drudge of children's pictures.
411	It would be a nice little family film if not for the fact that the young heroes commit felonies in the name of saving the environment.
412	Endangered as they are, burrowing owls will be disappointed to learn that their cause has been hitched to a movie with little entertainment value, let alone credible strategies to save their environment.
413	But while Hoot's pro-environment message to kids is certainly worthy, the unquestioning, pro-vigilante angle doesn't sit entirely well.
414	Fun to watch although falling short of a real hoot, this latest in a barrage of family movies largely succeeds at keeping the kiddies entertained and their parents from nodding off.
415	Soporific effort.
416	Promoting environmental conservation, this bland family film never generates much interest in either its human or animal participants.
417	A safe, slight film that doesn't possess the chaotic hilarity I associate with Carl Hiaasen's best writing.
418	[An] enjoyable summer behemoth.
419	Nice as it would be to report that Ang and his co-writer/producer James Schamus had regenerated the summer blockbuster, we gotta poop the party.
420	An interesting effort to give one of the staples of mass entertainment something extra in the way of insight and feeling.
421	Big, dopey and crammed with special effects that take the breath away.
422	Despite the profusion of computer-generated effects, which rousingly bring the green guy to life, I often felt, for better and for worse, that I was watching a comic-book movie reconceived as a piece of serious mythmaking.
423	Whatever problems it has as a story, at least Hulk tried, honestly and desperately, to push the comic book move into new places emotionally and stylistically.
424	The Hulk lacks personality; not a great movie.
425	The best comic book adaptation I've seen so far with an excellent cast and top notch special effects...
426	A turgid, CGI-Frankenstein reject
427	The spectacular special effects and Lee's use of split screens provide some relief in a nonetheless tedious tale in which Nick Nolte (looking much like his recent mug shot) provides several unintentional laughs as Banner's father.
428	The film almost matches the inner conflict of its titular character, intermittently bogged down even as it soars to seemingly impossible heights.
429	It has just enough charm to be watchable.
430	The filmmakers can't seem to unearth the novel's inherent lightheartedness and instead treat too many events with earnest seriousness, trampling the original story's lively spirit in heavy-handed drama.
431	With eloquent dialogue but scant smoldering passions, the mushy machinations nicely nudge director Tim Fywell's gentle little film.
432	Dollops on the usual romantic, family and class conflicts with a very heavy ladle, which pretty much smothers the whimsical mood Fywell strains so hard to attain.
433	A refreshingly mature look at first love and life's often-rough transitions.
434	Never shies from indulging us and our desire for a gentle and generous world that doesn't slip into easy answers.
435	The fancy-pants accents and period costuming make one feel intellectually smug, as if the afternoon had been spent watching a Merchant-Ivory film - only without the tedium of actually sitting through a Merchant-Ivory film.
436	Romala Garai is utterly convincing as the smart, wistful girl with the notebook.
437	A quirky and handsome family drama that nicely captures the pangs and pleasures of adolescence.
438	Better on set-up than follow-through.
439	A lame-brained nut job in search of an identity of its own.
440	A nihilist project in Usual Suspects mode: Nothing is as it seems, because nothing matters in the least.
441	[A] very well made horror thriller.
442	Assorted examples of artificially flavoured humanity ... proceed to panic, bicker and run with the customary perversity that characters in situations like this do toward their gory destinies.
443	Deserves credit for at least trying something fresh in the psychological-thriller realm, and for the mood of goofball creepiness it creates.
444	My eyeballs were doing some serious rolling of their own at the general ineptitude of this failed mating of Friday the 13th and Ten Little Indians.
445	the central twist which unifies all the film's elements is so ingenious and unusual that recognising the killer ends up being just one small part of this film's multi-faceted identity.
446	Scary beyond belief serial killer thriller.
447	A good cast is enacting this fancy rubbish; what drew them to the material besides its self-conscious cleverness is beyond me.
448	The cast is game, the twists are clever, the writing is tight.
449	This worthy second biopic of Truman Capote starts not with a bloodbath, but a cocktail.
450	All that was painted grey in Capote becomes black-and-white here.
451	Two good films about one subject [are] much better than a lot of bad films about different things.
452	Jones gets everything -- the gestures, the generosity, the mean streak, the bending of the ear to recitals of woe, whether across a lunch table or a prison cell.
453	The problem with Infamous isn't that it revisits Capote's turf -- it's that it does the same things well, and leaves the same unsatisfying holes.
454	There's a breeziness to the storytelling, one that delights in the tale rather than succumbing to its gravity-but that also works against it.
455	The other-and possibly greater-Capote pic about the geneiss of In Cold Blood
456	Better than Capote
457	Toby Jones' uncanny portrayal of the short, effeminate writer with the funny voice, gives the film its credibility and compassion.
458	Only Sandra Bullock shines as Harper Lee.
459	There's a sugar coating to the way Papale's story unfolds, but not so much that you'll spoil your dinner.
460	Even Papale's most famous play, recovering a fumble to set up a touchdown, is embellished, as if Disney can't bear to stick with the facts.
461	Invincible is a working-class jock Cinderella fantasy with the sincerity of a beer commercial, the soul of a Republican incumbent, and the designer-flannel esthetics of an old Bruce Springsteen video.
462	It may not break new ground, but Invincible is an entertaining film, awash in clichés but leavened by the charismatic performance of Mark Wahlberg as Vince Papale.
463	What's modestly refreshing about the way this story is told by director Eric Core and writer Brad Gann, is that the person with the largest doubts about going pro is Papele himself.
464	Inspiring sports-underdog story for tweens and up.
465	Mark Whalberg is surprisingly good, delivering a likeness to the real Vince Papale that is uncanny.
466	I wonder how many more of these inspirational sports films we have to sit through in 2006.
467	Screenwriter Brad Gann shares the guilt for this predictable cinematic travesty along with composer Mark Isham whose bombastic musical score is akin to hammering a nail with a shotgun blast.
468	Invincible is the story of Vince Papale, who was an actual figure -- a part-time bartender who went to a tryout, survived training camp, made the Eagles team, and became a Philadelphia legend.
469	You can call it guilty of exploitation, tastelessness or insensitivity if you like, but its greatest failing is a certain deadly pointlessness.
470	dispicable
471	Victims outshine their captors
472	Because we only see one side of the events, "Karla" rings unconvincing and sensationalistic.
473	...hopelessly inept and thoroughly awful...
474	What proves most disturbing is the way in which the film portrays Homolka as a victim.
475	Controversial and innately creepy, it left me feeling... well, dirty.
476	Gladiator lite.
477	If this is history demystified, give me myth.
478	It's hard to care about a valiant groping for accuracy when a story is so badly told you can't tell what the devil is going on.
479	By going back to its origins and dusting itself off, the King Arthur story has proved itself to have a very contemporary resonance.
480	Entertaining, but ultimately forgettable.
481	Fuqua creates a very grim and stylish mood that fits what the concept is attempting to accomplish very well.
482	Guinevere, no dainty princess she, is a kind of hardened medieval feminist, and the aggressor to Arthur's bashful but equally driven warrior, in both bed and on the battlefield.
483	In many ways this movie tells us far more about the values and age in which we are living, than the one it pretends to be returning us to.
484	Quite le drag.
485	This is an insignificant film with a passably entertaining premise that goes wildly to hell the instant it strays from its comic ideals with brief, unsatisfying detours into the realms of art and high-end lingerie.
486	It is a well-dressed film filled with thought and sly observations.
487	It pokes along like a Renault on an interstate, lacking drama or momentum.
488	It's all perfectly pleasant, but the movie lacks an urgent dramatic pulse, or a clear sense of whose story it's supposed to be, or even, from scene to scene, whether it's meant to be a comedy, drama or thriller.
489	A delightful blend of American sensibility and French chaos in a movie that is sunny, surprising and consistently entertaining.
490	Not a frothy romantic comedy.
491	Naomi Watts steals the movie.
492	The movie is least successful when it tips from semi-serious to too-serious.
493	Its annoying need to be witty, profound, funny, and charming at all times makes what could have been a smart comedy a tiresome exercise in pleasing its audience.
494	At the end when we should be thinking about love and lessons of maturity, we are left with Isabel shrugging off her latest mistake and charging headlong into who-knows-what.
495	Le Divorce is tres mediocre.
496	All indie-movie families may start out unhappy in their own way, but by the time the final credits roll, everyone remains complacent, confident of their brood's superiority.
497	Sunny or dark, comedy should never be as predictable as Little Miss Sunshine.
498	... a scrappy human comedy that takes an honest path to laughs and is twice as funny and touching for it.
499	... this isn't much more than a glorified sitcom, but it deftly dramatizes our conflicting desires for individuality and an audience to applaud it.
500	For a movie generated from the Amerindie algorithm of family dysfunction, road-trip catharsis and studied quirk, this dark-edged ensemble comedy often borders on the loveable.
501	Hilarious, profane and as much fun as you are going to have in a theater this summer.
502	Sentimental low points and contrived idiosyncrasies aside, Little Miss Sunshine still boasts wonderful performances, a cheeky sense of humor and an original story.
503	An achingly deliberately madcap family adventure that skates by thinly on the collective charms of its ensemble cast.
504	While the screenplay is impressive and deserving of its recognition, it is Alan Arkin's performance-of-a-lifetime that separates this from other well-written small movies.
505	Harmless enough as passable road movies go, but I can't help but wish directors of films like these would grow some damn balls.
506	Sundance-calibrated sitcom
507	I loved it, every bit of it.
508	Be very afraid.
509	London's pretensions far outstrip its dorm-level contemplation of life's big issues.
510	You should avoid it like a bad case of whooping cough.
511	It's not so interesting to watch people on cocaine babble back and forth at each other.
512	The title refers to the name of one of a grouping of some of the most numbingly self-absorbed and obnoxious characters ever assembled in a single film.
513	...ultimately comes off as a well-intentioned failure that admittedly might hold some appeal for fans of the various actors...
514	An acting exercise (and not a very interesting one) disguised as a film.
515	...if you don't mind watching people who are better looking than you coking up for 90 minutes...
516	...witless and pointless.
517	While it shouldn't work, it does.
518	This is cloying, deceitful, and more or less irresistible.
519	This is an embarrassment, an overdrawn rom-com gone very wrong.
520	A highly engineered puffball.
521	All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie until, in the end, it went somewhat bonkers with what amounted to a communal love fest on Christmas Eve.
522	Whatever the actors are given to do they make so delightful -- or so delightfully moving -- that Love Actually wins out over its wobbles.
523	... a terrific film.
524	Aside from all the hearts and flowers, though, it's Bill Nighy's uproarious turn as an over-the-hill rocker promoting a novelty record that really delivers the laughs.
525	Seldom have we seen such an extensive ensemble of talent in the movies yanked through the material like lambs on their way to a slaughter.
526	A long running time, too many characters and too much whimsy and corn make this romantic romp more of a slog than a soufflé.
527	Romantic and entertaining -- for older teens.
528	About as swashbuckling as a history lesson gets.
529	A few too many amateurish techniques and oversimplified confrontations hold Luther back a notch or two from greatness, and stamp it instead as entertaining Lutheran cheerleading.
530	Shot on 100 locations in three countries and outfitted with impressive props, costumes, art direction and medieval streets, Luther makes up for what it lacks in vigorous storytelling with such production values.
531	Heady theological badminton, as vigorously thoughtful as it is piously historical.
532	even with apparent lack of objectivity, LUTHER proves to be more interesting and more accurate depiction of history than anything recently produced by Hollywood
533	Interessante por natureza (o tema é fascinante), o filme perde pontos pela frieza da narrativa e por simplificar idéias e alguns acontecimentos fundamentais na vida de Lutero.
534	It glosses over the brilliant monk's dark side and ignores his prejudices completely.
535	An effective history lesson, but not nearly riveting enough to be as entertaining as it is earnest.
536	An entertaining, well-crafted primer on one of the most important Christian leaders since Jesus Christ.
537	Luther is the textbook radical: he acts out what his contemporaries merely profess.
538	Boring and bedraggled.
539	Lame scatalogical gags and worn pop-culture parodies abound, but the CGI animation romp is somewhat redeemed by the scene-stealing appearances of several supporting characters.
540	Madagascar is great good fun, not only because the filmmakers have enlisted some wonderful voice talent but also because the visuals truly are marvelous.
541	Very much in the tradition of Looney Tunes and Termite Terrace.
542	A foursome of digitally animated zoo animals escape the inner city confines of Manhattan's Central Park Zoo in search of freedom that's not be all it's cracked up to be in this well-defined children's comedy.
543	The character design is ugly; the main characters are often annoying; the humor is generally weak; and the computer-generated animation is often soulless.
544	A shallow attempt at filmmaking and humor.
545	...an engaging little diversion that maintains its charm with repeat viewing.
546	Amiably entertaining.
547	Matchstick Men never really casts off its cloak of artificiality and calculation; its pleasures are minor, however distracting they may be.
548	Ridley Scott lets us enjoy the satisfying clicks and whirrs of the well-oiled celluloid con trick, while leaving plenty of head room for Cage to twitch and fret in.
549	A thoroughly absorbing hour and 56 minutes of entertainment.
550	Matchstick Men is really two movies brilliantly spliced into one, each enriching the other.
551	It's a blah little exploitation picture that thinks it's a deep humanist parable.
552	Matchstick Men isn't even remotely intricate; it's not even particularly interesting.
553	This is a movie about con games at every level.
554	Nicholas Cage gives his best performance since "Leaving Los Vegas" as con man Roy Waller in this sophisticated movie about familial responsibility, self-imposed barriers and the possibilities of a well executed long con.
555	A cleverly planned switcheroo story in which the twist at the end is the knife in the back.
556	Something less than the sum of its parts, Matchstick Men is a decent film that should have been a considerably better one.
557	Too much of a hodgepodge of borrowed ideas and uneven tone.
558	A bizarre (and sometimes repulsive) exercise that's a little too willing to swoon in its own weird embrace.
559	Unfolds with the creepy elegance and carefully calibrated precision of a Dario Argento horror film.
560	Exactly the kind of unexpected delight one hopes for every time the lights go down.
561	[Bettis] has a smoldering, humorless intensity that's unnerving.
562	Lucky McKee's pansexual patchwork carves up perfection to celebrate flaws.
563	A marvelous cinematic debut from director Lucky McKee...
564	"May" takes a cracked view of 1 Corinthians' idea of leaving childish things behind - blending the brooding of "Frankenstein" with the bleak, acrid tone of Alkaline Trio lyrics and the most frightening sing-song horror-film score since "Suspiria."
565	Proves that fresh new work can be done in the horror genre if the director follows his or her own shadowy muse.
566	Benefits from bursts of gory black humor as well as Bettis' riveting performance.
567	If you can tolerate all this phony uplift you'll also get a pretty interesting story about a shrewd Minnesota college coach named Herb Brooks.
568	[T]humbs up for this uplifting and inspirational movie about one of the great upsets in sports history.
569	Russell is terrific as coach Herb Brooks.
570	Big on slogans, but low on personality.
571	The movie brings the audience back to 1980 with bone-crunching verisimilitude.
572	Moving story of the 1980 Olympic hockey team.
573	Even if you don't know a "blue line from a clothes line," "Miracle" is a thoroughly enjoyable film that unspools like a Robert Altman movie where many characters' individual essences are revealed at once.
574	This isn't anyone's finest hour.
575	Russell is at his understated best in the film, which stands as a living tribute to Coach Herb Brooks.
576	Women of the Fifties, rise up in protest.
577	Anyone who's ever been moved by a teacher to dream a slightly bigger dream than his parents thought he or she was capable of achieving ought to love the film, for it gets at a truer model of teacher's inspiration.
578	Like the turtleneck cashmere sweaters and girdles that tie down these promising women, the movie is trite and trussed.
579	Rather than being a fascinating exploration of a much more constrained time in our social history, the film simply feels anachronistic.
580	Glossy entertainment value but far from art.
581	Kirsten Dunst, Julia Stiles and Maggie Gyllenhaal furnish well-observed performances that frequently outshine Julia Roberts's reflex characterization in this female variant of "Dead Poets Society."
582	...would have been better served by characters with a little less formula than the paint-by-numbers projects so loved by these women of Wellesley College.
583	Mike Newell directs a formulaic Roberts vehicle that isn't without its charm.
584	Mike Newell takes the road most travelled in tackling the sexual apartheid and hysteria of the 1950s.
585	It's no surprise that a script this addicted to fortune cookie utterances would fall short on presenting a sane, realistic version of China.
586	Crap is still crap no matter what pretty gloss you throw on it.
587	More of the same...
588	It's harmless, sure, but it's also charmless.
589	It's a smart, mesmerizing and often angry film, from a truly confident filmmaker, but it remains, maddeningly, just beyond our grasp.
590	Everything that keeps it from being lovable could be looked upon as a virtue, and everything about it is intentional.
591	Munich ricochets all over the place, but it hits its target dead-on.
592	It's an incoherent film, as if Spielberg desperately wanted to say something important and could only come to the conclusion that killing is bad and we're all human.
593	Munich is more measured and classy than Spielberg's action-adventures.
594	Spielberg described Munich as his 'prayer for peace,' yet his movie strangely lacks the eloquence and yearning of a prayer.
595	Laceratingly charged, thunderstriken virtually, by Spielberg's deeply felt moral analysis
596	It is in many ways Eastwood's tightest movie for some time, and certainly his darkest since Unforgiven; indeed, the ending offers as corrosive an assessment of the limits of American justice as anything in his career.
597	Sean Penn is so frighteningly good in this movie that he outdoes even the best of his earlier work.
598	Works as a straight-up detective story, and the acting is often breathtaking.
599	Too depressing to fill audiences with delight, but it does seem to validate questionable attitudes, especially an indifference to the suffering of innocent people and a willingness to shoot first and ask questions later.
600	Solid, rarely showy performances, meticulously recreated detective work and moments of pure unadulterated grief accent this whodunit, a movie that will have those who haven't read the book fooled for much of its length.
601	The entire cast did a phenomenal job, resisting the urge to overact too much, which is what you get for a film like this.
602	American drama doesn't get any more meaty and muscular than this.
603	The performances are uniformly superb.
604	Good, occasionally powerful noir that's been overhyped.
605	As the two cop manqués overcome their dearth of common sense to save the day, the film achieves a comic playfulness.
606	Despite some tasty contributions from Lawrence and Zahn, too much of National Security has the bland flavor of microwaved leftovers.
607	Someone has to save us from Lawrence's onslaught of cinematic dross.
608	A lame blend of comedy and action in which both credibility and laughs are blown to smithereens.
609	A retread of all those buddies-in- the-cop-car pictures of the 1980s; not even slightly dusted off.
610	Indistinguishable dumb action comedy.
611	If... Martin Lawrence and Adam Sandler [were] in the same movie, it might... create an anti-comedy field so strong that both their careers would be sucked into the vortex...
612	A patently offensive, racist and repulsive waste of celluloid, an affront to blacks, whites and human beings in general.
613	Put your hands up and back away from this rent-a-flop.
614	If rampant misogyny and racism sound like a laugh riot, by all means see National Security, a 'comedy' so aggressively unpleasant that it's worthy of squirms.
615	As disposable as they come, National Security is a modestly entertaining re-hash of cop-buddy films of the 80s.
616	A mild holiday caper, for the wettest of afternoons.
617	This movie is a fortune wasted.
618	National Treasure gets more entertaining as the preposterousness rises.
619	So bad on so many levels.
620	Taken simply as a popcorn flick, National Treasure has its pleasures.
621	Historical adventure is a fun romp for tweens and up.
622	Though Turtletaub's direction is inspired, everything else from acting, to plot, and dialogue falls flat...
623	Not only safe for Junior and Grandma but also pretty entertaining.
624	Turteltaub manages to stitch it all together well enough so that the ludicrous nature of the characters' quest doesn't hit you until the final credits roll.
625	If you can see the film through the eyes of a child -- one who thinks a cheesy thriller is the ideal way to pick up new facts about history -- then this isn't that bad a yarn.
626	Has almost nothing to recommend it (Justin Bartha's performance being the lone high point), not even any gnarly explosions, which doesn't bode well for our man Bruckheimer.
627	Ultimately, Jordan's vision is so murky that Ned Kelly remains as foreign to us as wombat stew.
628	If Ned Kelly is supposed to be an anti-hero to root for, his speeches border on parody and his cause is really unclear.
629	Offers a couple of well-filmed showdowns and lots of pretty landscapes, but you need more than scenic views and stylish action to chronicle a life, especially one as controversial as Kelly's.
630	A leaden retelling of the legend of Australia's Jesse James that has understandably been sitting on the shelf for a couple of years.
631	A handsome, action-packed biographical drama with a credibility gap wider than the screen.
632	Ledger, talking into his chest for much of the film in an apparent effort to lend gravity to his performance, is pretty stiff, but so is Jordan's direction.
633	Much as late 19th century Australian outlaw Ned Kelly was a charismatic figure who won the adulation of the Irish immigrant masses there, Heath Ledger as that romantic revolutionary of the film's title breathes astonishing vigor into the role.
634	Director Jordan fails to deliver a film worthy of such mythical figure.
635	The story might have more resonance with Australians, since compared to American folk heroes Ledger's Ned Kelly comes off as a bit square and self-serious.
636	[A] tricky film, punctuated by bursts of staccato surrealism and bitter humor...
637	Rises above its own shortcomings through Heath Ledger's electric embodiment of Ned.
638	Ned Kelly suggests that not only do you not need anything of interest to watch, but you don't even need to see it at all.
639	One of those unpleasant fiascoes meant to lodge a lump in the throat at Christmas, but it only ends up making you want to bludgeon the elves with their own toy-shop hammers.
640	The nut-ball factor is just too high for these characters.
641	The kind of sappy, sadness-turns- to-gladness holiday movie that shows up on cable TV this time of year.
642	Palminteri draws some very good performances from his cast -- only to pile on a lot of shameless heart-tugging on top of a contrived script about five New Yorkers facing Christmas Eve alone.
643	The mawkishness meter is turned up full blast by the time Williams, wearing the hangdog expression he saves for maudlin dramas, shows up out of nowhere as a former priest to save an unhappy Sarandon from jumping into the East River.
644	I can be sentimental under the right circumstances, but the movie is such a calculating tearjerker that it played like a challenge to me.
645	I had a very hard time displaying malice to this.
646	Pleasantly watchable.
647	A film about folks celebrating Christmas together is about as interesting and carries as much dramatic thrust as the 1989 Christmas reunion video immortalized on Uncle Fred's camcorder.
648	The sentiments are right on the money, but the execution never quite filled me with holiday cheer.
649	There's nothing at all surprising about Noel, except for the fact that it was ever made.
650	If you are looking for a Christmas film that is unconventional, that has a lot of heart without wallowing in sentimentality, this is a good bet.
651	Only fitfully funny, except when Ferrell is onscreen -- then you won't stop laughing.
652	A flatland of lowest-common- denominated retro-collegiate wackiness.
653	This is a raucous frat-school comedy that's dopey, degrading and disgusting -- and consistently hilarious.
654	a nonstop gag machine, subscribing to that time-honored comedy philosophy, 'throw enough at the wall and something will stick'.
655	An extremely funny and, of course, socially unredeemable comedy.
656	Very politically incorrect; funny for many adults.
657	Flawed, cliché, contrived, and poorly developed...
658	When an Oster Breadmaker gets some of the film's biggest laughs, you know the thing's in trouble.
659	The lead males give impressively modulated performances that keep the laughs flowing as all hell breaks loose.
660	Will Ferrell is a fearless comedian, and he commits completely to his insanity in the film, and that makes it work.
661	Both brutal and lyrical, writer-director Park Chan-wook's existential nail-biter has torture scenes that will have you avoiding dentists, sushi bars and badly appointed hotel rooms.
662	Shakespearean in its violence, Oldboy also calls up nightmare images of spiritual and physical isolation that are worthy of Samuel Beckett or Dostoyevsky.
663	There's a lot less here than meets the eye.
664	Quite an achievement then, and well worthy of its Cannes prize.
665	It's hard to make an argument for Oldboy based on anything other than pure cinematics, but when the style speaks this loudly, it's an argument worth making.
666	It's mesmerizing and discomfiting, engaging the viewer on a visceral and an intellectual level.
667	One of the best imports I've seen in a while...
668	I think it's a sweet film.
669	A precocious fairy tale made for and starring people too old for whimsy
670	While uneven, this Ugly Duckling redux is hipper and funnier than a Disney movie, and the positive message to young girls can't be discounted.
671	The semi-satirical treatment of celebrity culture, as Penelope is treated first as a tabloid sensation then a media darling, is lame and dated.
672	Sweet as gingerbread, Penelope deserves to find an audience; those with a taste for happily-ever-afters should look for it, before it too-quickly disappears.
673	This quirky, snarky contemporary fairy tale could have been a family blockbuster.
674	I can truthfully say that watching this abysmal fantasy-comedy is less rewarding than being slapped across the face with a large wet fish.
675	Watchable but patchy fantasy romance that doesn't quite work, despite strong performances from Ricci and McAvoy.
676	A modern-day fairytale, the film is tarted up like a hyperactive five-year-old's lurid fantasy of interior decor.
677	Visually stylish, what might have been a cute fantasy becomes tedious due to its banal script and a relentless overload of pig-jokes.
678	These ingredients are digitally present and correct, but Hogan fails to inject much excitement into the many boisterous action sequences.
679	With only a few exceptions, the performances (and the script) range between dull and mediocre.
680	In this incarnation, Peter is imbued with a greater degree of psychological darkness than before.
681	Familiarity doesn't exactly breed contempt, yet despite the novelty of a real boy as Peter, the movie does engender a listless been-there / eaten-that reaction.
682	A tribute to the power of good storytelling.
683	On the whole it's a pleasant thing, if hardly the definitive treatment of the source material.
684	It won't give Harry Potter a run for his money, but it beats the hell out of a Cannon & Ball panto in Skegness.
685	Live-action version keeps its thrill and charm.
686	Great performances, rollicking action and excitement, and a beautiful story kids will surely love...
687	Siendo notorio el gusto de Hogan por las letras clásicas de Peter Pan y Wendy, el director sabe educir el alma del libro para llevarla al celuloide.
688	PJ Hogan's lazy, logy Peter Pan states that not growing up is a tragedy, but presents neither evidence nor arguments.
689	It's a fitfully engaging romance, it's just not Pride and Prejudice.
690	Keira's cat-smile suggests such supernal all-knowingness that, with Austen's adapted dialogue (via Deborah Moggach) tripping off her tongue, she comes off as an eighteenth-century Maureen Dowd.
691	Wright wastes no time in squeezing the plot into his just-over-two hours running time, but the film never feels rushed, particularly when so much of it is spent watching and waiting, as the characters come to understand the world they live in.
692	I just feel like I've seen this so many times.
693	As historically authentic-looking as Pride & Prejudice is, it has far more invested in emotional authenticity -- you feel engaged every moment.
694	This movie was stuffy, boring, cumbersome and all around annoying to me.
695	oe Wright should be applauded for delivering a vividly realised Austen adap -- one which confirms Knightley has graduated from the Jackie Bisset of the '00s to this decade's Julie Christie.
696	OMG I loved this movie so much that I have to turn in my Manly Man Club ID card now.
697	Pride and Prejudice is a gorgeous and well-acted adaptation.
698	Director Joe Wright's filmic rendition of Jane Austin's classic novel is sumptuous but never fussy.
699	za obi%u010Dnu publiku, %u010Dije %u0107e potrebe za kvalitetnim filmom zadovoljiti ova holivudska obrada knji%u017Eevnog evergrina, koja po svemu sude%u0107i nije posljednja.
700	Scary, puzzling, and different.
701	An unapologetically cerebral movie of ideas.
702	It's one thing to admire what writer/director/composer/actor Shane Carruth wrought on his $1.98 digicam budget; it's quite another to have to sit through the mind-numbing results.
703	The ingenious debut of writer-director Shane Carruth, who assembled the film on his home computer and also plays one of the two leads, is purposely designed to be a little bewildering.
704	Where's Doc Brown when you need him?
705	Shot for a begged and borrowed $7,000, 'Primer' looks it: grainy-ish, fuzzy on details and effects, acting running the gamut from A to B, and clipped incomprehensible technobabble for dialogue.
706	Ridiculous, confusing, vaguely noir-ish nonsense.
707	An exceptional science fiction film...
708	Madden stages the action with a minimum of imagination and gets a career-worst performance out of Davis in a key role, but the material still sputters to life on the strength of the writing and Paltrow's commitment to the part.
709	Sadly, the impact of the clever parallelogram of emotional and philosophical concerns in Auburn and Rebecca Miller's screenplay is deadened by the director's overly literal -- mechanical -- cinematic interpretation.
710	Madden does a competent job transferring the film from stage to screen.
711	Few movies regard the psyche with such sober discernment.
712	Miscast yet marvelous, Paltrow and the rest of the cast hold you to the movie, even when you intuitively sense something is lacking.
713	A limp, and utterly pointless melodrama that's never as intelligent as it thinks.
714	Timid staging faithful adaptation = no cinema
715	offers a convincing demonstration of the theorem that good writing and sensitive performances can equal an engaging and nuanced piece of cinema.
716	full review in Greek
717	As a story about personal and family dysfunction, and about coming to terms with life's uncertainties, Proof isn't bad.
718	Based-on- a-true-story kitschfest.
719	[Y]et another movie that takes a mentally challenged character and turns him into this kind of deity, this saint-like mascot who everybody else learns life lessons from.
720	Gooding once again embarrasses himself in public with a performance that knows no shame, a habit he's getting frighteningly at ease with these days.
721	A train wreck of a film lying inert where the tracks of the Feel Good Line cross the Path of Good Intentions.
722	Though probably well-intentioned, Radio comes off as manipulative of its audience and exploitative of the mentally challenged.
723	Rarely have good intentions been wrapped in such a sticky package.
724	Despite the fine efforts of Harris and Gooding, Jr., Radio nearly drowns in James Horner's overbearingly sentimental music.
725	Lesson of kindness permeates inspiring true story.
726	Awful from start to finish.
727	The screenwriter seems obsessed with introducing dramatic conflict, which feels both strained and convenient.
728	Tune in for another formulaic feel-good story that will warm your heart and chill your mind.
729	Feigns compassion for the mentally challenged, but treats Radio as a pet, a toy, a prop.
730	The movie, directed without a personal stamp of any kind by Chris Columbus, is so slick that the grime comes from a spray can and the grungy bohemian costumes look rented from a Betsey Johnson boutique sale.
731	The film captures the beautiful spirit and the raw energy of Larson's play, and it respects the wonderful, gorgeous, life-affirming music.
732	RENT is mediocre and recommended only to those who can claim a familiarity with the play.
733	A mediocre, unimaginative, inefficient filmmaker, Columbus delivers a Rent that isn't so much bad as perfunctory.
734	As directed by Columbus, Jonathan Larson's East Village reworking of 'La Boheme' in the age of AIDS retains its calisthenic pathos, as well as most of its original cast, but you'd have to be a real Rent-Head to envisage Academy Awards in its future.
735	As strong as the music is, there's not much tying Rent together; it's a series of sequences, not a story.
736	A TV-special metallic ring hangs over the whole production, skimming surfaces without touching emotion
737	If a bunch of models living in a huge apartment without income is America, then I live in Bizarro World...
738	film, za razliku od predstave, daleko bolje isti%u010De jednodimenzionalnost i neuvjerljivost likova
739	Recommended, but only for shut-ins who can't make it to a local live theater production of the play.
740	Crafted with obvious care and deep love by director Chris Columbus and his team.
741	[A]bout as compelling a brief for Kabbalah as Battlefield Earth was for scientology.
742	Not the disaster described in the British press but unlikely to restore Ritchie's luster.
743	It's an irritating, repetitive and pretentious psycho-metaphysical con-job that's ultimately about transcending the ego, and it owes a significant debt to the 1960s The Prisoner TV show -- but isn't nearly in the same artistic league.
744	Guy Ritchie's greasy little noir Revolver is good grindhouse fun until a last act that's like a meeting of a psychoanalysts' convention.
745	Between the manic editing, atrocious acting, and laughably pretentious narration, Ritchie's tired tricks feel like empty distractions in a game of three-card Monte.
746	Incoherent.
747	An unwieldy, short-circuiting film, packing "more tricks than a clown's pocket" yet imbued with brute spiritual force
748	Jesus, this is a stupid movie.
749	It's not worth the bother.
750	Like De Palma before him, Ritchie knows how to express substance through style.
751	The ol' lug can't be blamed for wanting one last victory lap, but if you've got nothing to offer except benign nostalgia, just let the gloves stay on the glory-days shelf.
752	When asked why he would step back into the ring, even though he's out of shape and in his late 50s, the Italian Stallion mumbles something about "the stuff... inside," which sums up the thin justification for Rocky Balboa.
753	What gives Rocky Balboa its unexpected pathos is the titanic humility of Stallone's performance, the earnestness with which he plays a man knocked down (but not out) by the ravages of time.
754	As usual with Stallone's Rocky sequels, the schmaltz is unbearable, but the fight is plausibly handled, and Stallone's sincere sadness at growing older makes this an unexpectedly satisfying conclusion to the series.
755	...a strong capper to an admittedly uneven series...
756	A compelling and emotionally touching film that reminds of the first two Rocky movies, Rocky Balboa is an excellent finale which shows just how good an actor Sylvester Stallone is when given the right material.
757	You either buy into this premise or you don't and I'm sorry to say I found Rocky utterly preposterous.
758	Stallone still has what it takes to make Rocky the peoples champ, and while the film is by no means a knockout, it will certainly be right there 'til the final round.
759	Note to any other would-be franchise revivalists -- consult Stallone.
760	Stallone wrote and directed this cinematic ride down memory lane that puts a final grace note on his indelible creation.
761	Despite the vast beauty of location settings in Morocco and Spain, the vast lack of chemistry between the two stars is appalling.
762	A mediocrity wrapped inside a banality, toasted in a nice, fresh cliche.
763	Unlike Raiders of the Lost Ark, which this movie wants so desperately to be, there's nothing here to engage the brain along with the eyeballs.
764	For an adventure movie based on chase scenes in exotic locations "Sahara" never takes hold because director Breck Eisner and his team of screenwriters can't agree on what the story's about or what tone should resonate against it.
765	The whole movie is a kick, actually.
766	A pretty offensive comedy about Africans who range from primitive to demonic that, sorry, is just not funny.
767	Vapid, lengthy, and mostly lifeless -- kind of like the desert it's named for.
768	Sahara rather resembles National Treasure, another film with a strained story line and deadening lack of visual richness.
769	Though dumber than a box of rocks, Saw forges ahead with the kind of conviction and energy that will keep bad-cinema junkies sitting bolt upright.
770	[Its] sadism is topped only by its absurdity.
771	So over the top that even the recruited audience of non-critics at my screening began to howl.
772	James Wan's horror film Saw is full of demented twists and guilty-looking actors, but the scenario is cruel enough to make you squirm.
773	Saw is a sub-Se7en B-movie serial killer chiller with more high concepts stuffed into its 100 minutes than it can handle.
774	[A] contrived, unlovable gore-fest with a high-concept premise.
775	There's something impressively loathsome and extravagantly twisted about this horror-thriller from first-timer James Wan.
776	School of Rock made me laugh harder than any movie I've seen this year.
777	A cathartic class comedy for kids of all sizes, it's Bugsy Malone in rock pomp, Slacker meets Spy Kids.
778	School of Rock is uncut bliss.
779	[A] great big ball of entertainment ...
780	Standout Jack Black in nerd-becomes-cool comedy.
781	Jack Black is a one-man rock 'n roll powerhouse in this infectious musical comedy directed by Gen X wunderkind Richard Linklater...
782	Not only will your kids love this movie, but, hey, they'll learn what real music is.
783	It's another case of independent film artists beating Hollywood at its own game.
784	Respectable when it should be thrilling, honorable when it should be rough and ready.
785	[It] may be too airbrushed for its own good, but in the end nothing can stop this story from putting a lump in your throat.
786	I found this film stultifyingly self-important and, despite the regularity with which it cuts to the chase, weirdly static.
787	For a film about an unfancied underdog, Seabiscuit is just far too pleased with itself.
788	Watching this movie, you get the feeling that the Depression existed so that Seabiscuit could be memorialized.
789	In the structure of his screenplay Ross has taken a risk, and he has not quite brought it off.
790	promises filet mignon, only to deliver oats and hay
791	An inspiring story for teens and up.
792	Becomes a tale about beating the odds, the triumph of competition, and how one small animal can bring a nation together to forget its miseries.
793	Seabiscuit is not a work of great art, but it tells its solid story with grace and dignity.
794	Mixing horror and humor is no mean feat, but Shaun Of The Dead tightens throats in fear without making the laughs stick there in the process.
795	The pasty, scruffy Pegg shows a surprising amount of range for the unlikely hero of a zombie flick.
796	The movie bogs down and the humor seems to dry up, though the blood continues to well, spurt and spew.
797	The cast make a cosy fit, the patter is still sitcom snappy, but Wright also has the visual snap to carry this saga of backyard apocalypse.
798	For those who don't mind a little laughter with their zombies (or perhaps it should be the other way around), this is an unusual source of entertainment.
799	It may only be April, but what we have here is pretty likely to be the British comedy of the year, its knockout final punchline planting a silly grin on your face that takes some while to fade.
800	Despite the emphasis on humour, Shaun shows its zombie movie credentials with some impressively gory special effects makeup and a willingness to despatch cast members in an exceptionally gruesome fashion.
801	Some scenes are too talky, too much like a sitcom, but whenever that threatens to sink the film, the zombies appear and save the day (if you see what I mean).
802	For everyone who likes good acting and great writing, it's a bloody fun time and a wonderful display of how parody should be done.
803	If you like Pegg and director Edgar Wright's cult Channel 4 series Spaced, you'll enjoy this deadpan blend of undergraduate humour and hardcore horror, which ransacks George A Romero's Dead saga and virtually every Italian zombie flick for inspiration.
804	Pegg, who cowrote Shaun with director Edgar Wright, shows off expert timing, whacking punchlines and zombies with equal panache.
805	Intelligent, funny and moving.
806	Payne has made a movie for the same sorts of people, one with body and 'nose' and character that movie lovers will savor long after the credits have rolled.
807	Much like Altman, Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder -- three filmmakers whose movies are celebrated for their naturalism, their humanism and their wicked, often merciless satire -- Payne makes films about ordinary people with their rumples and flaws left intact,
808	Payne's most enjoyable movie since Election
809	Excellent but explicit movie is not for kids.
810	Giamatti handily raises what could've been a pedestrian road trip romance into the stratosphere of a world-class character study
811	A very memorable slice of life.
812	This wonderfully satisfying study in human nature is funny and sad and profoundly entertaining from start to finish.
813	With a huge, well-chosen cast and the blessing of Miller, who was on set as Rodriguez's co-director, Sin City is a gloriously stylized world unlike anything you've seen before on screen.
814	For all its astronomical body count, Sin City is brazenly, thrillingly alive.
815	While Sin City on screen evokes the same feeling of bottomless decadence and dread that the novels do, there is one crucial difference -- you can put the novels down.
816	While the book succeeded in pushing the boundaries of its medium, the film merely feels like a triumph of technology.
817	A worthwhile piece of eye candy.
818	If Raymond Chandler and Daffy Duck could have produced a child, Sin City would be their baby.
819	With every bloody, stylishly seductive moment, it crashes through comic book movie conventions to blast through the screen as a mesmerizing and captivating crowd-pleaser.
820	Now that I've seen the late-arriving sequel, I can't for the life of me work out why I ever thought it would be a good idea.
821	So hyper-dramatic that even the most horrifying elements play as a sort of quiet camp rather than bland torture porn.
822	This extremely violent movie is NOT for kids.
823	Smartly written and sprightly played, Sky High satisfies with a clever commingling of spoofy superheroics, school-daze hijinks, and family friendly coming-of-age dramedy.
824	Harmless family comedy with welcomely loopy asides.
825	Funny, clever and even a bit inspirational, hinting at the potential for heroism in all of us.
826	With a crisp and snappy visual style and its smartly paced story, Sky High pulls an incredible feat in an age of dumbed-down kids comedies; it's as down-to-earth as it is super.
827	Sky High may set a record for ripping off more movies in just over an hour and a half than any other film in history.
828	Sky High is the latest Disney teen comedy about the pitfalls of adolescent life, but is much, much better than it seems like it should be in large part due to its strong cast and assured direction.
829	Cartoony high school superhero drama; OK for tweens.
830	surprisingly clever, spirited and joyful
831	...achieves a miraculous level of kitchy zip thanks to its creative casting of Kurt Russell, Lynda Carter, and Bruce Campbell.
832	I'm a sucker for comic book movies, and "Sky High" won me over...
833	Just kind of a mildly entertaining footnote.
834	Stay is interesting, but it's hard to recommend to anyone but the small cadre of David Lynch devotees who will inhale anything with a whiff of similarity to their favorite auteur's scent.
835	In Marc Forster's humorless thriller, going insane is an exciting, luxurious affair.
836	This is the kind of flop that makes even the popcorn taste lousy.
837	There's a lot of talent at work here from the cast to the screenwriter to the director and the visuals, but it's all so arbitrary and cheap and the payoff is so, so lame.
838	It's all very deep, but in a tricked-up, art-directed sort of way.
839	A sappy melodrama touted in a supernatural angle...
840	Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling all lower their box office merit with this unbaked psychological thriller about a suicidal man (Gosling) taunting his eccentric psychologist (McGregor) after surviving a horrible car accident.
841	Stay wants to be good, creepy fun, but by the middle of the film, I was so uninterested in the plot I became obsessed with McGregor's pants
842	Ultimately the film delivers such a weak payoff that it makes nearly everything that came before it seem rather pointless.
843	If we're going to be fighting the war on terror in perpetuity, could we at least get better movies out of it?
844	Aiming to join the Jerry BruckheimerJerry Bruckheimer/Michael BayMichael Bay school of American movie war games, Stealth is just too dumb to make the grade.
845	Stealth manages to be so ridiculously unconvincing you think you're watching a live-action version of last year's sublime action-movie puppet satire Team America.
846	Rob Cohen's airborne adventure Stealth commits the cardinal sin for an action movie: It's very, very dull.
847	...a crude Jerry Bruckheimer knock-off with a laughably insipid script...
848	Memorable for being forgettable.
849	Neither entertaining nor exciting, the dumb and noisy Stealth will hopefully live up to its name by fading quietly from movie theaters.
850	It's basically the videogame version of Top Gun... on steroids!
851	Undoubtedly a perfect example of everything that's wrong with contemporary action flicks, although the movie isn't quite as bad as it's been made out to be.
852	... a chocolate-coated mothball, tasty enough on the outside but unsafe to swallow...
853	Using mostly unknown and first-time actors, Loach spins a passable coming-of-age tale, which should please his fans and provides a diversion for the rest of us.
854	Despite this film's title, don't expect something light and fluffy.
855	There's a profane but strangely tender rawness to this sometimes brutal movie, anchored by Compston's remarkably assured debut performance.
856	A raw movie, but it relies on the natural appeal of its main character and the skill with which Loach creates a thoroughly believable environment.
857	The film is so alive, the performances so urgent and convincing, that it's as if Loach had just discovered the subject matter.
858	...a better-than-average slice-of-life kitchen-sink drama that benefits substantially from Compston's star-making performance.
859	Under Loach's deft hand, it feels indisputably real ... An undeniable downer, but hellaciously well acted, brimming with compassion, and relevant in a way that doesn't chafe.
860	Hollywood has manufactured a number of coming of age films of varying quality, yet it's difficult to think of one that tops this powerful character study
861	Sharp dialogue and detailed observations make it a good deal funnier than you might expect.
862	It's not a good sign when a movie is called The Break-Up and you can't wait for the couple to split so they'll get some relief from one another, and give the audience some relief from them.
863	One seemingly terminal problem with the casting of Ms. Aniston and Mr. Vaughn is that neither of their careers has featured characters who excelled at one-to-one relationships with the opposite sex.
864	The movie offers nothing funny, just a series of sour situations.
865	The Break-Up, a grim excuse for a romantic comedy, is basically an hour and 45 minutes spent in the company of two unpleasant people during a miserable time in their lives.
866	The Break-Up is a funny and light comedy, but it tries to be something a bit more without being something a bit more, hampered by shoddy characterization, ending up a bit empty.
867	The two stars remain painfully wrong for each other
868	Is anxious to be a modern "Annie Hall," but really it is just a tedious, glum, and god awful affair.
869	"The Break-Up" comes with a slap and a kiss that's at once bracing and pleasing.
870	A word of caution to anyone heading off to see The Break-Up with the assumption that it is a romantic comedy: this is not a comedy movie with a serious side -- it is a serious movie with a comedic side.
871	Stereotypes across the board, puerile one-upmanship games, and an utter failure to explain why, indeed, these two even were together.
872	Not one second of this bilge makes a lick of sense.
873	Kutcher is the wrong actor to anchor a psychological freak-out.
874	It's as if [Kutcher] decided that he would prove himself as a dramatic actor by trying out every clichéd serious role in the history of cinema.
875	It's one of the most unpleasant Hollywood films in some time.
876	A flawed but serviceable thriller.
877	...an above-average time travel picture that ultimately utilizes (and exploits) its out-there premise quite nicely.
878	The movie tries to be too visceral, and it just comes out as being repugnant
879	It's a pretty dumb and utterly pretentious jumbled drama that is never sure what it's trying to say, or what in fact it means.
880	Tries hard to be affecting and mind-blowing, and sometimes it comes close.
881	More like "The Gag Reflex."
882	Undigestible fusion of worst-case earth science and leaden pacing.
883	[I]t's not campy enough to be consistently entertaining, and it's certainly not exciting or smart enough to be a first-rate sci-fi epic like a Deep Impact.
884	Jules Verne this isn't, but it makes for fairly diverting escapist fare.
885	There's a marked absence of panic in The Core.
886	Scientists may shudder, but at least some good actors are getting work.
887	The Core works because the characters are idiosyncratic enough to seem authentic but not so zany that they seem contrived.
888	...pervasive mediocrity...
889	A magical film: it never runs out of new and delightful ways to be completely inane.
890	This is a big, dumb, explosion movie.
891	'The only truly interesting aspect found in "The Core" is Jon Amiel's thoughts as to what the inner parts of Earth might look like.'
892	Should be a sci-fi screenwriter's dream; but this dream is more like one that Michael Crichton would have than Jules Verne, and there's not a breath of imagination on display
893	Many of the clichés in this movie predate the last Ice Age.
894	A shambles of dud writing and dramatic inconsequence which left me determined to double my consumption of fossil fuels.
895	... the situations are just so ludicrous that it really detracts from the quality of the special effects ...
896	An exceptionally stupid movie.
897	For all of its dire premonitions, foreshadowings of horror and easy targets for Jay Leno jokes, The Day After Tomorrow is eye-poppingly awesome and wonderfully entertaining.
898	It fulfills its summer air-conditioning duties with flippant ease, and its enjoyably cloddish attempts at political relevance add a fascinating layer of incongruity.
899	if you want to see Mother Nature kick some butt, this is your bag
900	"Trite" really isn't doing justice to the degree to which [the film] has not a single thought, character, or line of dialogue that hadn't been run into the ground by the beginning of the '80s.
901	Some cool special effects...that's about it.
902	This is a popcorn film with a fact based concept, and that's all it is...
903	...a movie that not only expected me to pay attention, it assumed that I could.
904	The girl and the hospital patients and staff also turn up in his improvised adventure, extravagantly garbed by costume designer Eiko Ishioka.
905	An achingly beautiful movie and a triumph of location scouting, with more cosmopolitan spectacle than the past three Indiana Jones and James Bond movies combined.
906	Sometimes, looking good isn't enough.
907	So what if the front story is a little contrived?
908	I wonder if it's unforgivable heresy to say The Cell is badly underestimated and due for revisionism while The Fall, despite its relative obscurity, is badly overestimated.
909	The story Roy tells is involving enough and so beautifully shot (see how many locations you can name) that it's worth seeing for that alone.
910	The production values are above par, but as in Carpenter's original, seeing ghosts is less scary than imagining them.
911	Yet another anaemic horror retread starring a cast of good-looking TV totty.
912	Mildly scary here and there.
913	Like most remakes, The Fog is pretty unnecessary.
914	Making concessions at every turn to the youth-horror market, the film slashes the ages of its protagonists by some 15 years, and its IQ follows suit.
915	These studios just don't know when to quit while they're ahead.
916	A boorishly bland supernatural action thriller.
917	Even the geography of the film doesn't seem to make sense.
918	So concerned is the film with contriving at least one gratuitous jump-fright every five minutes that elements like character and story soon become lost in the fog.
919	A lousy remake of a not-so-good John Carpenter film.
920	Don't be afraid.
921	Lurches on a thin line between hyper-ornate space oddity and extended perfume advert.
922	The Fountain is the story of a gifted artist who dared to reach for the stars and paid for his ambition with a really stupid movie.
923	Mr. Aronofsky's outlook on life remains too constantly pessimistic for my taste, and too completely joyless as well.
924	Darren Aronofsky clearly didn't set out to make a usual movie...[The Fountain's] a story of overreaching that itself overreaches, but that might have been impossible to avoid.
925	This is one of the worst movies of the year.
926	Perhaps in twenty more years or so, [The Fountain] will be recognized for the utterly gorgeous masterpiece that it is.
927	The enormous, and sometimes inspired, visual arc of Aronofsky's reach sadly exceeds his narrative's basic grasp.
928	A metaphysical muddle.
929	It's difficult to recall another American film that, in pursuing a passionate and personal vision, goes so maddeningly, uproariously wrong.
930	The continuous sense of deeply felt discovery tempers the movie's overreaching pretentiousness
931	While one might have wished for a better movie, and a few smarter decisions regarding the screenplay, generally it's a riveting, even inspirational account of an American feat of arms about which few know but about which many more should.
932	Feels less like a rousing action adventure than a military-sponsored lesson in invincible patriotic payback.
933	Dahl's approach may be somewhat pedestrian, but he tells his story clearly and with few unnecessary detours.
934	The story line is telegraphed from word one and the meticulous unfolding plot plods ahead inexorably without the slightest bit of suspense.
935	This smart, unhurried drama plays out like a retro version of Saving Private Ryan.
936	A great story filled with real heroics deserves better than this.
937	Undeveloped secondary characters and awkward pacing thwarts the movie from achieving its '60s war film ethos similar to "The Great Escape."
938	Instead of a tribute to a fine chapter in the annals of the Greatest Generation, we have a second-rate romance right out of a cheesy, pulp fiction novel.
939	A well-produced, rousing feature based on one of those forgotten World War II episodes that make for great cinema.
940	While the historical events depicted were unusual and cause for genuine celebration, the film that depicts these events is a dull, by-the-numbers set of war-movie clichés.
941	This one offers some agreeably mindless fun in which the villains (including Norton) are truly villainous, the payback is satisfying in a purely infantile way, and the familiarity of everything is oddly comforting.
942	This unglamorous approach has the odd effect of making them seem more glamorous -- we're free to soak up their star quality because there's no hard sell to fight off.
943	A strangely satisfying though completely preposterous caper movie.
944	A tricked-out remake of a heist flick that was already flat and formulaic in 1969.
945	Wide-open absurdity would've helped; instead, there's a clotting of musical interludes and a general air of stoic grit.
946	Exciting heist film for teens and their families.
947	It is in Gray's spirited execution that such by-the-book formula makes for a brisk, slick entertainment hits the summer movie spot.
948	A fun bit of action comedy with a bang up cast.
949	The Italian Job turns out well, a fast and entertaining caper designed to give you a couple of fun hours.
950	Gary Gray's version is tauter, better made but insufficiently idiosyncratic to attract a cult following.
951	Gray adds some zip to this remake of the 1969 Michael Caine caper flick, but despite two clever action sequences and some uncharacteristically tight performances from his cast (most notably Charlize Theron and Mark Wahlberg), the con remains the same.
952	Competently mounted in its studiedly immersive, elongated way, Zwick's earnest costume epic dresses a knee-jerk, reactionary sensibility in exotic garb.
953	Disappointingly content to recycle familiar attitudes about the nobility of ancient cultures, Western despoilment of them, liberal historical guilt, the unrestrainable greed of capitalists and the irreducible primacy of Hollywood movie stars.
954	The script lays on hokey narration and bombastic dialogue.
955	Mostly, though, The Last Samurai aims for, and achieves, epic sweep: the glory of tradition-bound warriors hurling themselves against the modern world, the grandeur of Hollywood offering two points of view on everything.
956	does honor traditional Japanese culture and ideals and make them accessible to a wider audience
957	Outstanding action and performance; lots of blood.
958	One of the best films of 2003.
959	More than anything else, "The Last Samurai" is the current Tom Cruise vehicle, and the actor's capacity to wrestle the story to his own demands is an impressive testament to his multifaceted perfectionist skills.
960	The real point of the film seems to be the poster image of a battle-ready Tom Cruise waving a sword and all decked out in gleaming red-and-black samurai armor.
961	Until now Bale's screen persona has been defined by a graceful athleticism; here his physicality is repellent, yet he carries the occasionally creaky plot of Scott Kosar's unsettling screenplay to a resonant finish.
962	One can't deny the dubious appeal of the spectacle of the skin-and-bone Bale, quite possibly endangering his health for the sake of his art.
963	[Bale's] is a great performance, full of commitment and sacrifice, and The Machinist is one of the year's best films.
964	It's one of those movies that you admire more than you enjoy, but Anderson and Kosar are clearly talents to watch.
965	A stunt that didn't merit Bale's startling, and dangerous, transformation.
966	It begins dark and depressing, but ends up merely dull.
967	If Nine Inch Nails, Swans and Ministry ever loomed large in the landscape of your imagination, Anderson's gloomy aesthetic may exert a sour but lingering pull.
968	A brilliant, harrowing performance by Bale.
969	It's not necessarily a fun or loveable picture, but it is interesting and entertaining.
970	With time as a buffer, it's now easier to see The Machinist for what it is: a labyrinthine leap down the rabbit hole into a nightmarish wonderland.
971	A brilliant psychological horror story, and excellent direction...
972	Here, shorn of every ounce of body fat, Bale is laid open like an autopsy specimen, and he easily gives his best performance.
973	Happily, this extremely timely entertainment matches, even perhaps surpasses its predecessor.
974	Demme serves the picture completely.
975	Strikes me as a very artful cover -- about the cleverest imaginable transliteration of the story from its historical moment to ours.
976	Far from a disgrace, but it's not freewheeling enough, not strange enough to make sense of our gathering dread.
977	Beautifully made and unsurpassingly creepy, it's the rare remake with something contemporary to add.
978	If it isn't the original's equal, The Manchurian Candidate conjures up an air of menace sufficient to make most modern thrillers look like romantic comedies.
979	Sleek remake is more violent than original.
980	This humorless and nonsensical update of The Manchurian Candidate - a total misread of Frankenheimer's classic original - never quite engages, devolving the original's camp and satire into self-serious melodrama.
981	A rather decent imitation in the end with political subtext and very good performances.
982	It is as shocking now as it was forty years ago, but nothing in the 2004 version approaches that level of intensity, intelligence, or audacity.
983	Demme's direction is as punctilious as it was in Silence of the Lambs, careful with details and craftsmanlike with storytelling -- although we do have to work a bit to stay on top of things.
984	These whispered ruminations are beautifully written, but whose voice are we hearing?
985	The New World isn't Terrence Malick's best, but it's guiding him in the right direction.
986	The New World laps over its audience like water on a deserted beach, moving so quietly that you almost don't notice that it's enveloped you.
987	The New World is stately almost to the point of being static and thus has trouble finding a central story around which to arrange itself; it's not quite the thin dead line, but it's close.
988	He [Malick] swoons for his own well-honed image as a painter of woodland idylls, a man who leaves no sway of wheat or ripple of water unmet by his fatherly gaze.
989	Through elliptical and seemingly oblique methods, he [Malick] forges moments of staggering emotional power.
990	Any ambience created in tandem by Lubezki and Malick repeatedly dissipates in the face of the plodding treatment of fascinating material.
991	Great works, when they next-to-never come, are always accompanied by giggles.
992	Malick manages to do something I never thought possible, and that's make America seem like a New World to begin with.
993	Discovery is a sensory experience by nature, and to lightly run one's fingers through someone's hair in The New World is to know them in some fundamental way.
994	It is about the dreams we have when we are awake but in a state of absolute peace and perfect self-reflection.
995	The connection between the two narratives is supposed to be a big, heartbreaking surprise, though I figured it out well in advance and spent the interim unfavorably comparing this greatest-generation hanky wringer to the British drama Iris.
996	How rare to see a film that says there is still a value system out there, that being thoughtful and caring is not uncool.
997	The movie not only approaches a level of shamelessness you have to see to disbelieve, it does it in a manner that's both inept and crass.
998	May be one hundred percent sap, but its spirit is anything but cloying, thanks to persuasive performances, most notably from Rachel McAdams.
999	This is a movie that isn't ashamed to wring each teardrop by any means necessary.
1000	Our resistance is broken down, and the hankies are out.
1001	If you ever want to see a flawless example of a movie which is redeemed from mediocrity solely through the cast, there is hardly a better one than this.
1002	A very engrossing and entertaining sudsy romance with top notch performances.
1003	for someone who loves these sorts of stories, it would be a fantastic movie
1004	I prepared myself for a tearjerker; what I didn't prepare for was an outright gusher.
1005	This is extraneous for anyone who's seen the original film or show, presumably leaving everyone else to wonder what all the fuss has been about.
1006	Not so much a film as an awkwardly framed souvenir of the Broadway hit musical, The Producers needs a live audience like a candle needs oxygen.
1007	... an unabashedly old-fashioned musical filled with song, dance, and shtick so shticky you could hang wallpaper with it.
1008	Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Gary Beach have their singing, dancing and kvetching in the Broadway smash The Producers immortalized on film.
1009	There's a song in the stage musical version of 'The Producers' that, if you flipped the title to pose the opposite question, could summarize the letdown diehard fans will feel if they catch the new movie of Mel Brooks' gloriously retro Broadway smash.
1010	The original was far funnier and somehow managed to cut to the chase with less of a song and dance.
1011	Be prepared to laugh from the opening credits through the closing credits.
1012	The play is everything in this uneven movie, which is alternately groan-inducing and side-splitting.
1013	Confirmed my original opinion that the musical version of The Producers was a flash-in-the-pan success that won't be remembered ten years from now.
1014	Director Stroman (who also choreographed the film) has also paid tribute to the theatre by casting such stage stars as Brent Barrett, Debra Monk, Karen Ziemba and Andrea Martin.
1015	The real reason to see this film is the addition of the musical numbers -- catchy and clever songs, written in the style of classic 1950s Broadway musicals.
1016	There's something to be said for letting a comic book adaptation operate at the level of a comic book, dispensing cheap laughs and ice-cold sadism.
1017	Ultimately, Frank's victim -to-vigilante transformation is so morally unexplored it's emotionally alienating.
1018	There isn't a moment in The Punisher that isn't borrowed or stolen from another movie.
1019	Mismanages its greatest asset: an unusual embarrassment of camp riches.
1020	... a lot of fun.
1021	Gets us lost early in the first half-hour and never succeeds in completely luring us in.
1022	good fun to watch the bad guys drop like flies
1023	Bad big screen adaptation of comic book.
1024	Standard, styleless revenge fantasy.
1025	Despite some admittedly strong moments it's certainly nothing special and barely above ordinary.
1026	If you thought "Daredevil" was lousy, then you'll be thoroughly irritated by the asleep-at-the-wheel pacing of the story of the Punisher's origin.
1027	Yet another trophy in Marvel's movie gallery...
1028	A lesser director might make all of this deadly earnest, but Frears treats it as what you might call a tragi-comedy of manners, perfectly serious but human foibles everywhere.
1029	Both [Michael Sheen and Helen Mirren] understand the prickly push-and-pull that defines the fight -- the Gray Monarch v. the Great Modernizer -- and give quiet gravitas to the polite but firm standoffs.
1030	With its lavish imagery and elegant writing, The Queen is a majestic film, and Mirren is the heir apparent to be crowned best actress of the year.
1031	Allows us to understand just how heavy the crown really sits.
1032	Helen Mirren gives perhaps her most remarkable performance in an already remarkable career.
1033	The Queen will knock your socks off.
1034	Stuffed with stinging truths about swiftly turning winds of public opinion, Stephen Frears' film is a tough, fair-minded and, at times, morbidly satirical depiction of the extraordinary circumstance of leading in grief as well as government.
1035	Trenchantly stages its climax around the passing of an era
1036	Surely to be considered at Oscar time.
1037	Here I suspected the ultimate villain almost from the very beginning -- and, if I wasn't fooled, I can't imagine anyone else will be, either.
1038	The Recruit weighs in like a porous brick of recycled polypropylene.
1039	I liked all those set pieces where they set up these elaborate schemes, and you're not sure who the good guy is, and the bad guy.
1040	A conjurer's trick that delights for about an hour, then spirals into idiocy.
1041	A compelling, if throwaway, drama.
1042	It's nothing but style and noise, threadbare of content, empty of ideas.
1043	Above-average thriller, but not very memorable.
1044	I'm still hoping Pacino will dazzle with a great performance eventually...
1045	The film still makes a diverting entertainment in spite of its obviousness.
1046	Pacino's puppet-stringing of his recruit is reminiscent of Peter O'Toole's manipulative character in 1980's 'The Stunt Man.'
1047	As someone who's watched more bad movies than you can imagine, I'm mostly immune to the so-bad-it's-good aesthetic, though I can see how, viewed in a theater at midnight after a few drinks, this might conjure up its own hilariously demented reality.
1048	The Room, has been maligned as one of the most inept movies ever made when in fact it is a sardonic comedy about sexual politics in the age of terror.
1049	Given audience reaction at screening attended, pic may be something of a first: A movie that prompts most of its viewers to ask for their money back -- before even 30 minutes have passed.
1050	One of the only films from the whole of the 21st Century to live up to every fragment of its hype.
1051	If there is a 21st-century Edward D. Wood Jr., it is probably Tommy Wiseau.
1052	Trust me, you've gotta check this thing out at least once, especially if you like football.
1053	A movie so bad, so inept, so unbelievably painful, it's almost impossible to comprehend anyone thought it would be great on-screen...
1054	The question becomes, How much punishment can the audience take and still keep on howling?
1055	Watching The Room is like crossing over to a counterfactual universe where the rules of film grammar and screenwriting have been written by Dan Brown.
1056	Cult-phenom amateur melodrama best left to adults.
1057	A mediocre time-waster
1058	[The film] has more holes than Bush's war plan and employs less fluent English.
1059	Nobody's better than Michael Douglass as playing that guy who makes that big mistake, and then spends the rest of the movie trying to atone for it.
1060	If you're going to make a movie with the same title as a second-rate horror film, it should at least be as entertaining as that second-rate horror film.
1061	A well-constructed and genuinely tense thriller.
1062	Michael Douglas goes through the motions of playing an action man in this plodding and pedestrian political suspense thriller.
1063	An underwhelming political thriller.
1064	Douglas possesses an everyman appeal that is used to good effect in this movie to keep the audience securely on his side.
1065	way too predictible
1066	The fast-food of the genre - it "gets the job done" and fills you up, but the hunger for more will undoubtedly return sooner rather than later.
1067	A notch above most such throwaway thrillers.
1068	The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie takes on rather too much water during its extended feature-length submersion.
1069	The Nickelodeon cartoon series about an oceanic sponge and his starfish sidekick washes onto the big screen with a tide of weak one-liners, exaggerated reactions, and vaguely nauseating gags.
1070	Anyone expecting anything more risky will be sadly disappointed.
1071	Could SpongeBob, all gangly goodwill and ice cream appetite, be the anarchic savior for our stressed-out times?
1072	If you are a non-parent and you're entertained by this, wow, good for you.
1073	Like the TV show it's based on, it's a daffy, enjoyable creation.
1074	Very similar to the edgy animated TV show.
1075	It's never afraid to break out of movie conventions and revert back to its series randomness and sheer Monty Python-esque humor that made it a hit with kids in the first place.
1076	Brilliantly funny, inventive and delirious.
1077	The new feature film has some of the charm of the small-screen original, but it lacks the sustained goofiness of the series.
1078	It's an odd fable: Viktor is the mysterious visitor who shows us what the American Dream is all about-in the movie's terms, compassion for others -- without ever wanting to become an American himself.
1079	Even in the desolation of an airport lounge at midnight, Viktor is too pure, we realize, to entertain the ghost of a dirty thought.
1080	A feel-good film of such originality and sweetness in a summer of otherwise derivative sequels and remakes that it practically qualifies for miracle status.
1081	This is the first time in my life I wanted to spend more time in an airport terminal, and Spielberg is just such a brilliant filmmaker; the things he does with light and with motion and some amazing tracking shots.
1082	Probably the worst-directed film Spielberg has ever made.
1083	Spielberg was able to make a post-9/11 film about a foreigner in an American airport without getting on a soap box about terrorism or airport anxiety
1084	Lovely and well worth sharing with your family.
1085	A crowd-pleasing and entertaining film about humanity and heart with excellent performances and competent directing from Spielberg.
1086	Amiable if rather toothless fable.
1087	A great filmmaker doing minor work.
1088	The Terminal's conclusion was as awkward and aloof as O'Hare Airport in December.
1089	Neil LaBute's utterly misconceived remake of Robin Hardy's 1973 cult horror film is a boring, fright-free catastrophe.
1090	Despite retaining significant chunks of Shaffer's dialogue to go along with the basic story structure, LaBute has transformed the eerie, disturbing psychological thriller into an unintentional comedy.
1091	The Wicker Man is comically inept as a horror movie, unable to even manage an effective false scare, or sustain suspense for more than a beat or two.
1092	An exploitative mystery horror film in which Edward Woodward overacts his heart out.
1093	When The Wicker Man offers more laughs than Talladega Nights, it might be a sign for the auteur to switch brands to comedy
1094	Nicolas Cage gives the worst performance of his career opposite Kate Beahen in this useless update of Robin Hardy's far creepier 1973 original suspense movie based on Anthony Shaffer's novel.
1095	Laughable, awful, and downright ridiculous.
1096	A numbingly reliable tick-tock of expository set pieces alternating with vast CGI-aided battle scenes.
1097	A fairly routine action picture with an advanced case of grandeuritis.
1098	Harsh, serious, and both exhilarating and tragic, the right tonal combination for Homer.
1099	The latest in a very long line of films made to give us those things that other mediums could not provide.
1100	It's massive, opulent, passionate and -- unlike most summer time-wasters -- surprisingly intelligent.
1101	... several of the scenes are just some of the best battle scenes I've seen in a long time.
1102	overblown historical epic
1103	An adaptation of The Iliad that would have had to work much harder to miss the point of The Iliad any more thoroughly.
1104	Violent, watered-down version of The Iliad.
1105	While an achievement in visuals, Troy fails in every other aspect including its writing and storytelling.
1106	Despite its shortcomings, Troy is a visual smorgasbord.
1107	The face-off between Achilles and Hector is beautifully realized, all the more wounding because we can precisely read each man's emotions going into the fight.
1108	This thriller seems most interested in lingering over battered and bloodied male faces.
1109	Sarah Thorpe's screenplay is a compendium of by-the-book clichés; Kaufman's direction leaves the material stranded in a limbo between po-faced and trashy; Judd's approximation of drunkenness is worrying to behold.
1110	The outdated, cliche-riddled direction is so inept and indifferent that it's hard to believe Twisted was lensed by the same Philip Kaufman who made The Right Stuff.
1111	A suspense thriller without thrills or suspense.
1112	Judd is let down by Twisted because tearful, confused victim doesn't come naturally to her; she's not fun to watch suffer if you can't see her calculating the payback.
1113	This movie plays like they were reading [Roger Ebert's] little movie glossary and they took every cliche in there.
1114	Numbingly predictable, inept, and boring.
1115	At least the performances are solid.
1116	Judd, Samuel L. Jackson, Andy Garcia and David Strathairn all are wasted.
1117	Overcooked dialogue, some wildly implausible story devices, and a dearth of remotely likable characters, and Twisted is a crime story that just doesn't pay.
1118	Twisted is so bad I'm embarrassed to have seen it and therefore am a bit ashamed to write even an unkind review.
1119	Just like nearly all of Judd's past entries in the genre, this film isn't great, it's just average.
1120	The most receptive audience will mainly be enlightened to know that you can make a movie as thoroughly unprofessional as this one and still get it released in 3,000 theaters.
1121	Despite the expository speeches draped over this like birthday bunting, the story remains largely incomprehensible.
1122	Derivative, adolescent tosh.
1123	Ultra-dumb.
1124	Wimmer borrows all his best ideas from other movies...then spackles over his half-assed plot with a shiny aesthetic.
1125	Crank your brain to its lowest possible idle and you'll still overthink Ultraviolet.
1126	Woefully nonsensical from start to finish...
1127	One of the worst movies of 2006 so far.
1128	Really, you can't blame Ms. Jovovich.
1129	Undemanding, unengaging, and glaringly unoriginal, Ultraviolet gives real comic books a bad name.
1130	The narrative is so jumbled that even the actors can't seem to keep track of what exactly is meant to be happening.
1131	The epitome of what a feel-good movie is supposed to be but rarely is, this one is beautiful to look at and life-affirming to think about, and it doesn't have a pretentious bone in its head.
1132	The movie is sweet but deeply suspect: It's like Lost Horizon re-imagined by a realtor.
1133	... some of the most beautiful photography in any film I've seen this year.
1134	Has about as much in common with Frances Mayes as it does with Willie Mays, but it does have the marvelous Diane Lane.
1135	It is a glorious refreshment to spend time with characters who aren't twenty-something eye bait, someone's virtuous, whiny wife or other reductive archetypes.
1136	"Under the Tuscan Sun" is an amiable film that, in the tradition of escapist fiction, provides a nice, scenic getaway with just enough drama to keep the story from getting stagnant.
1137	Not much for teens in this book adaptation.
1138	a romantic abomination wherein the main character's best friend is a pregnant Asian lesbian who comes to Italy to visit and ends up ruining the story's only semi-romantic aspect, and extends its painful length for an extra half-hour in the process.
1139	An enjoyable, entertaining odyssey with beautiful landscapes, a fun mood, and a charming performance from the always sexy Diane Lane.
1140	Fans of Diane Lane ... should be happy with what amounts to a glowing vehicle for her.
1141	These vampires have no teeth -- hell, they don't even fly.
1142	The sort of movie in which the head vampire telegraphs his evil by using a cell phone and dressing like the Kinks' Ray Davies in the early '80s.
1143	Dark Shadows for the Playstation 2 generation.
1144	I've been waiting a long time to see a Shakespearean werewolf vampire movie and here it is.
1145	By any reasonable standard, this dark vampire epic -- all massive overacting, cologne-commercial design and sexy cat suits -- sucks.
1146	Pulpy, punk-ish story with some intense violence.
1147	...a hybrid horror and action film that succeeds as neither.
1148	Fails to deliver with anything truly tasty or memorable.
1149	...a relentlessly unpleasant fantasy epic...
1150	Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography perfectly captures the gothic comic-book feel.
1151	[Underworld] could use more plot and deepened characters and less vapid expository dialogue, flashbacks and ballets of bullets.
1152	I advise you catch up with Walk the Line, if only for Ms. Witherspoon's transcendent joyousness as a still-growing legend within a legend.
1153	Mangold was wisely generous with the amount of musical performance he included in the film, and the later scenes -- showing Cash and Carter as partners -- are so well shot and edited, they defy you to sit still.
1154	If Walk the Line isn't the full story of Johnny Cash, it's at least a crucial corner of it, a way of coaxing a legend down to a human scale, without shrinking that legend away to nothingness.
1155	Phoenix is terrific in Walk the Line - - the actor's taciturn, brooding persona dovetails beautifully with the role - - but it's his scenes opposite Witherspoon that give the movie its real spark.
1156	A Johnny Cash biopic equally packed with music and frustrated love, Walk the Line goes from compelling to enthralling.
1157	[Director] James Mangold's mostly excellent Walk the Line is designed as a Christian epic.
1158	It's a tidy Hollywood arc imposed on a messy real life, but it gets the job done.
1159	the acting compensates for the weaknesses in the script
1160	What made this film work, and what ultimately won it most of its acclaim, were the performances of the actors.
1161	Reverently reductive
1162	A fun, well acted, and well directed piece of filmmaking...
1163	Walk the Line isn't as great a biopic as Ray, but it's still a fine tribute to the Man in Black and his muse.
1164	Spielberg's calculations turn out to be more prominent than any effects they could possibly produce, and the less pretentious 1953 version by producer George Pal emerges as more likable.
1165	The film succeeds as pure sensation, an exacting distillation of fear.
1166	Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds is huge and scary, moving and funny-another capper to a career that seems like an unending succession of captivations.
1167	There likely won't be a more gripping film this year than Spielberg's War Of The Worlds, which at its best glides along like choreography with a camera, slowly parsing out information while shrouding the rest in shadow and suggestion.
1168	Overall, the film is too lacking in feeling to provide a recognizably human experience.
1169	It's a thrilling ride...[but] this bountiful pot of signifiers leaves a caustic aftertaste.
1170	The story is affecting, the action scenes are thrilling, the issues are resonant.
1171	Alien invasion thriller too scary for young kids.
1172	so impressive in so many ways that it makes the frustration over its miserable final moments that much harder to bear
1173	...in its own right it works well enough most of the time to pass an entertaining couple of hours.
1174	Most gags are as weak as they are derivative, offering little incentive to suspend one's disbelief, and as for the gender politics, well... you can only imagine.
1175	[I]t's the worst movie of the year.
1176	Banshee-howlingly awful.
1177	A tawdry excuse for a movie, but it has a handful of shameless giggles.
1178	The film feels long when it should be brisk, and it's bloated with stretches of hot, dead air.
1179	Predictable farce isn't very funny or original.
1180	It's bad enough watching a dreadfully unfunny really awful comedy, but watching a very racist comedy makes it all the worse...
1181	Complements the awfulness of its protagonists' Caucasian camouflage with putrid bathroom humor, pitiable romance and brainless racial/social commentary.
1182	Odds on you know what you're in for, so if you're prepared to shell out your reddies for it, you'll find it amicable enough.
1183	Think Mean Girls rewritten by Joe Piscopo.
1184	All in all, it's rather pleasant, but nothing else.
1185	The movie needs the stars' charm and director Richard Loncraine's polish, because the faulty script is just barely good enough to hold us for 100 minutes.
1186	A pleasant enough entertainment at a time when movies either pleasant or entertaining are in short supply.
1187	[A] reluctant thumbs down.
1188	The kind of movie that allows the non-cynical movie-goer to sit back and relax in the presence of actors who work well with each other and a script whose familiarity is an asset.
1189	Slick, satisfying entertainment.
1190	Works better as a sports movie than a love match.
1191	An enjoyable little crowd-pleaser with likable leads and a few good laughs.
1192	The story plays out predictably with a happy ending -- think The Natural on Wimbledon's Centre Court -- and all in all, it's a decent romantic comedy.
1193	You aren't likely to see a film with more warmth and good humor anytime soon, or one that does more to give feel good filmmaking a good name.
1194	Do we really need to see another film where a gorgeous, talented and desired American woman is whisked away by a stammering insecure British man with an inner monologue?
1195	Lobs nothing but clichés.
1196	After seeing these natural wonders, the elaborate special effects of such films as The Hulk and The Matrix Reloaded will seem like cheap parlor tricks.
1197	The photography is radiant.
1198	Flight as sheer freedom couldn't be better demonstrated.
1199	A film that will leave you dreaming about what it would be like to step off the edge of the world and discover you could fly.
1200	A life-affirming story that's enthralling, inspiring and poignant.
1201	It's a beautiful and oddly restful experience.
1202	As pretty and light as a feather on the wind.
1203	Jacques Perrin's spectacular documentary takes observation a step further as he literally seems to take flight with flocks of birds as they make their annual migration.
1204	Filmed with exceptional care and remarkable photographic ingenuity, no other nature documentary is as personal and as close-up as this one to the peculiarities of birds.
1205	Craftily edited and staged, but still works as an entertaining, and visually stunning documentary.
1206	The Oscar-nominated "Winged Migration" is a virtuosi technical achievement in documentary filmmaking due to its astonishingly intimate photography of the migrations of numerous species of birds across the earth's northern and southern hemispheres.
